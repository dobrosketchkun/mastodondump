Unpopular opinions are acceptable, explicit hate-speech is not. Respect others users right to disengage. CW nudity, and spoilers.  You must be 16 years or older and a S.T.E.M. student or professional to join our server. Membership is a privilege, not a right.\nWe won’t censor unpopular ideas and statements and welcome people from across the political spectrum, but hate-based speech such as sexist, racist, or homophobic speech will not be tolerated, be kind to each other.\nAll discussions between mods are public, as we believe that transparency is the best way to show everyone how we put words into practice. Check them out\non discourse\n, and jump in the conversation if you feel like.\n\nAdditional services:\n\nQOTO Groups\n-\nhttps://groups.qoto.org\n, a server devoted to moderated groups on the Fediverse.\n\nNextCloud\n-\nhttps://cloud.qoto.org\n\nGitLab\n-\nhttps://git.qoto.org\n\nGitLab pages\n(including user hosted pages) - https://*.qoto.io\n\nFunkWhale\n-\nhttps://audio.qoto.org\n\nPeerTube\n-\nhttps://video.qoto.org\n\nDiscourse\n-\nhttps://discourse.qoto.org\n\n\nUnique Features\n\nInline math Latex support - Use \\ ( and \\ ) for inline LaTeX, and \\ [ and \\ ] for display mode.\n65,535 character limit for toots (usually 500)\n65,535 character limit for profile bio (usually 160)\nFull text searches - usually you can only search hashtags and usernames\nGroups Support - Accounts which represent groups (such as those from Guppe) are now tagged with a group badge and are specially rendered so the messages relayed by a group appear to be originating from the user.\nDedicated Groups Server - The fediverses only\nmoderated groups server\nopen to the public.\nGroup Directory - Groups are federated in the group directory which, like the federated timeline, will list all groups followed by anyone on our server.\nMarkdown Posts - You now have the option to select markdown formatting when posting.\nCircles - You can now create circles with followers in it. When you make a post you can select one or more circles to privately post to and only users of those circles can see your post.\nPer-toot option allowing for local-only toots that wont federate with other servers\nLocal-only toot default - You can now optionally set all toots to be local-only and prevent all your posts from federating outside of the local server. Without this setting you can still select local-only on a per-toot basis.\nDomain Subscriptions - Bring another instance's local timeline as a feed in Qoto, no need to have an account on another server again, just import their timeline here!\nFavorite Domains - Our last release allowed us to add remote timeline as a feature where you could pull up the local timeline of a remote instance as its own column. Now you can also add domains to a favorite domain list which makes it easier to access and bring up the timelines by listing them directly in the navigation panel.\nUser Post Notification - Users now have a bell next to their name where the follow button is. This will send you a notification every time they makes a new post.\nKeyword Subscriptions - Create custom timelines based off keywords not just hashtags, you can even use regex for advanced matching\nAccount Subscriptions - This allows you to follow a remote accounts public toots in your Home timeline without actually following them. NOTE: This will not circumvent a user's privacy settings. It only delivers the same notifications as following someone via existing RSS feeds would allow, that is, it brings the RSS feed of their public posts into your home timeline this features behaves the same as the default functionality on non-Mastodon instances such as Misskey, Friendica, and Pleroma.\nMisskey compatible quoting of toots\nColored follow button - The follow button seen in the feed and in profiles (the one that can be optionally turned off in settings) will now be colored to indicate follower status. Gray if not followed, yellow if followed, blue if following, green if mutual follow\nBookmarking of toots\nSupport for WebP and HEIC media uploads\nOptional instance ticker banners under usernames in the timelines that tell you what server a user is on and what software it is running (ie pleorma, mastodon, misskey, etc) at a glance.\nOptionally display subscribe and follower buttons directly in your timeline feeds.\nRemote Timeline Quickview - From any post or profile there is a link to bring up the remote timeline locally, right in QOTO without needing to open a new window.\nProfessionally hosted with nightly backups\nlight modern theme with full width columns (not fixed)\nSeveral extra themes - including mastodon default and mastodon default with full width columns (not fixed)\nRead/unread notifications - Unread notifications now have a subtle blue indicator. There is also a “mark all as red” button added.\nRich-text rendering - We now render rich-text from other servers, so servers which post in a formatting that includes things like bolding, quotes, headers, italics, underlines, etc, will render in the statuses.\nRich-text Stripping - The user option to partially or fully turn off the rendering of rich-text.\nRegistration Captcha - A captcha is now required to signup for a new account, reducing spam.\nQuote feature opt-out - As introduced earlier you can quote a toot rather than just reboost it. This is an additional button on every toot. This can now be turned off in your settings and removes the button.\nBookmark feature opt-out - As with the quote feature we could previously bookmark posts. You can now turn off the bookmark button.\nFollow button opt-out - As mentioned earlier our added feature allowing you to add a follow button, optionally colored, into the feed can now be turned off.\nSubscribe button opt-out - As before the subscribe feature that lets you watch a users public toots without following them can now be optionally turned off.\nFavorite Tags - Similar to favorite domains this allows you to create a list of your favorite tags and have them easily accessible in the navigation panel.\n\nMessage to New Members\nWelcome to the QOTO Mastodon instance, its like twitter but better!\nPlease don't hesitate to Direct Message me ( @freemo@qoto.org ) or tag me in Toots (what we call tweets here) if you have any questions or even if you just want to chat.\nIf you are new to Mastodon you may want to check out this official getting started guide: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/\nWe are a free speech, no censorship zone. Feel free to talk about whatever you want, say whatever you want, as long as it is legal and you engage respectfully you won’t ever get banned from the server. With that said we do have a few rules: No spam, and no using multiple accounts to circumvent personal bans, and a few others.\nThis server isnt a typical mastodon server either. I have personally modified the code on this server to give it several unique features you won't find on other servers.\nIf you are new to Mastodon here is some useful info.\nBasically Mastodon is a decentralized service similar to twitter. That means anyone can run a server (like QOTO) that people can sign up with and use just like twitter. The unique part is how the servers talk to each other.\nIf you want to tag someone on the same server as you then you can just do @user however if you want to specify someone on a different server you can do @user@server. If someone follows you or mentions you on any server on the internet you'll get notified right here. So my full tag is @freemo@qoto.org.\nSo now a bit about the timelines, there are three (unlike twitter there is just one): Home, Local, Federated.\nThe Home timeline is just like what you'd expect on twitter, that is, everyone you are following.\nThe local timeline is any post made by anyone on your local server.\nThe federated timeline is what is cool. It combines the timeline of everyone on the server into one. This way you can see the posts of everyone that is followed by anyone on the server (assuming the post is public). So this timeline is a close representation of everyone on the internet who has Mastodon (though not really). Moreover we have a bot here that goes around and federates with everyone it can find, so our Federated Feed is rather robust covering thousands of instances.\nOnly other thing that is unique is listed vs unlisted posts. You have normal privacy settings like on twitter but you also can set a post to be listed or unlisted. If it is listed it acts just as i described. If it is unlisted then it acts just as a normal tweet would but it doesn't show up on local or federated timelines anywhere.\nAlso this goes without saying, but don't be racist, sexist, hateful, and don't harass people. It's a pretty shitty thing to do, don't be shitty!\nThe following is the list of QOTO administrators/moderators.\n\n@freemo@qoto.org\n@arteteco@qoto.org\n@Sphinx@qoto.org\n@Khird@qoto.org\n\nNote:\nThe account @QOTO@qoto.org listed as the administrator is NOT an actively monitored account. It was selected so as not to show favoritism among our moderator group, we are a democracy and even our administrators and moderators are held to the same high standards of decency as the rest of the community.\n\n***We will never advertise on QOTO or sell your information to third-parties***\n\nRules\nWhat will get you banned:\n\nAnything illegal.\nIntentionally creating a QOTO account to circumvent people blocking you.\nExplicit hate-based racism, sexism, and other hateful speech, but generally unpopular opinions voiced respectfully will be fine.\nBeing a bot (unless you post unlisted and do not auto-follow)\nAny account setup solely to advertise a product or service\nNSFW without a content warning\nSpoilers without a content warning\nBlocking of moderators is prohibited since it interferes with their ability to moderate content. However if you do not wish a moderator to comment on your posts outside of official moderator communication such a request will be honored.\n\nWhat won't get you banned:\n\nHurting someone's feelings\nAnything that can be solved by a personal block\nCursing\nLewd jokes\nA bot where all posts are unlisted\n\nWe are all adults here, act like it. Despite our belief in freedom of expression (free speech) we want to create a space where people are respectful to each other. Don't disrespect people; if they disrespect you then block them and move on. If we get a report on one of our users then an administrator will reach out to the parties involved and try to mediate a peaceful resolution. We will talk it through like mature adults. Lets remember there is a person at the other end of the screen, if we can be mature in real life we can do it here too.\n\nFederating: Silencing & Blocking\nWe do not silence or block other Fediverse instances based on agenda, politics, or opinions held by their staff or users. We only require servers we federate with to follow one simple rule: respect a user's right to disengage. Offending servers will only be silenced, not blocks, blocks will be reserved for technical assaults only such as DDoS attacks.\nSome examples:\n\nIf, for any reason, a user requests another user to not tag them, this request will be respected without exception.\nIf a user is blocked and it is clear the user who was blocked that this was directed at that user. Then creating additional accounts specifically to circumvent this block would be disallowed. If the user was unaware of the block then they wouldn't be accountable however.\nUnsolicited advertising must be opt-in only. This means commercial advertisements which directly tag individual users without permission from that user, especially when done in bulk, will not be allowed.\n\nWe understand that moderators will not always catch 100% of offenses above. If a server does not appear to be compliant with the above federation policy we will first reach out to the moderators of the server. If those moderators actively take action to handle those cases as they are reported then we will continue to federate. It will only be cases where moderators are made aware of the above cases, and fail to act, that will result in defederation.\nSimilarly if we receive anonymous reports on **any** incident of any kind from a foreign server directed at one of our own users, or we hear word of any moderation from a foreign server, we will always reach out to the admins of the other server, usually CC'ed from a non-QOTO account. However if any moderator or admin for any reason would not like to be contacted we will respect any such request as well.\nWe currently do not block any servers in the fediverse. We currently only silence the following servers in the fediverse, spinster.xyz and ussr.win\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse. These are the exceptions that have been made on this particular server.\nSilenced servers\nPosts from these servers will be hidden in public timelines and conversations, and no notifications will be generated from their users interactions, unless you are following them:\n\n\nServer\nReason\n\n\n\nspinster.xyz\n\nHarassment from users en masse, moderators were made aware and take no action against harassment.\n\n\nussr.win\n\nHarassment from owner including ban evasion through use of multiple accounts.\n\n\n",

        "aboutMore": "\n\nNNIA stands for Non Normative Identities Alliance, a group for marginalized and stigmatized demographics. The purpose of the movement is promotion of health and support for these people, public awareness in absence of shame and thought policing.\nNNIA was introduced as a concept on MAP twitter in 2019, as an attempt to find a common ground between the MAP community, the other paraphiliacs, queer people who don't want to discriminate against others, mentally ill people. We all have to live being stereotyped as predatory and less than human, and it's time to unite and make our voices heard.\nThe primary purpose of NNIA as a server is to connect people of marginalized identities who are under threat of silencing and erasure on mainstream social media and give them a space to talk and a feeling of stability. This is not a discussion platform between paraphiliacs and antis. However, polite and rational questions from occasional viewers are welcome.\nRules:\n1. Since this is a positivity and destigmatization space, no intolerant attitudes to other identities are allowed. As long as everyone lives safe, non-offending lives, they are welcome.\n2. Map contact discourse isn't allowed. While people with diverse views are welcome, all debates on questionable topics should occur in a special private chat on Riot.im (ask Lecter for an invite). Simply stating your contact stance stance doesn’t count as debating. However, the site administration isn’t contact-neutral, and general statements supporting anti contact ideology are permitted, but pro contact are not.\n3. Respect privacy and boundaries of other members. Disclosing personal information shared here to non-members isn't allowed, if you have a problem with another member, take it to the mods.\n4. Posting NSFW images is not allowed, however, occasional NSFW topics can be discussed (jokes, educational questions, etc). The requirements are that the discussion is impersonal (no sexting between members), appropriate content warnings are added, and the post setting are switched to \"friends only\".\n5. We don't condone sexual offending. People who want to use this space for grooming or sharing abusive images will be found and reported. However, if you're struggling with something and realize you need help, it's safe to write to us privately, and we'll do our best to connect you with a safe professional.\n6. Don't post images of real life children, even if that's your own childhood photos.\n7. While the server is in the test mode, the rules will be regularly updated.\nThings you need to know:\n1. Mastodon is a network of servers, each with its own staff, that permits anyone from any server to interact with anyone from any other server. This server is ours. But you can go chat with people from elsewhere.\n2. You are going to have 3 timelines. Home timeline will give you everyone you follow, Local will show everyone from NNIA whether you follow them or no (but only original posts, no replies), Federated will give you all content our members interact with, from any Mastodon server.\n3. You can regulate the degree of privacy of your posts. The globe icon that appears below the text as you write indicates public posting. You can change it by clicking on it.\n4. We as admins have access to everyone’s emails and IPs, and we’re not going to abuse this knowledge, but we recommend getting separate mails for map activities anyway, and a free VPN, such as Proton VPN, or Betternet.\n5. There are Mastodon mobile apps. Tusky for Android and Tootle for Apple are the most popular ones.\n6. The mod group watches members of other servers that interact with us. In case of any dangerous behavior (attempts to solicit illegal materials, doxxing threats, aggressive bigotry), their accounts will be banned from interacting with this server.\nUnavailable content\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse. These are the exceptions that have been made on this particular server.\nNo data from these servers will be processed, stored or exchanged, making any interaction or communication with users from these servers impossible:\n\n\nServer\nReason\n\n\n\n65a9c6be-328d-45d4-91ab-c5dc84f1f9b5.pub.instances.scw.cloud\n\n\n\ncompute.amazonaws.com\n\n\n\nkiwifarms.cc\n\n\n\nneckbeard.xyz\n\n\n\npub.cloud.scaleway.com\n\n\n\n\n",

Using alternate accounts to evade blocks/suspends/silences, whether on the same instance or another instance, is prohibited.\nAccounts from other instances will be locally silenced or suspended​ for reported violation of these rules. CoC violations by instance administrators may be enforced on the entire instance​, particularly for single-user instances.\nThese rules evolve on a regular basis. Most folks will never run afoul of them, which should give us hope for the future.\nGuidelines\n:\r\nThe following are suggested ways to be excellent to each other, in no particular order.\n\nIf someone is violating the rules, please report the toot(s) in question, and also consider blocking them.\nTry to apply content warnings/NSFW tags for long posts, animated GIFs, sensitive topics, etc. This is not a hard-and-fast rule, and we're not going to insta-ban violations, but keeping the Public Timelines usable for as many folks as possible is a goal.\nContent warnings should definitely be used for pornography, lewd roleplay, spoilers, curse-laden diatribes, photographs of gentlemen named Richard, etc. Content warnings may be used for news, politics, long stories, etc. Community standards are still evolving on this topic.\nIt's a good idea to check your privilege occasionally. Many members of this community identify as part of one or more oft-repressed minority groups (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, person of color, disabled, neurodivergent, etc). Don't expect individuals to produce peer-reviewed research to \"prove\" their experiences are real; if you're skeptical, do your own research or ask the community as a whole.\nWe don't really mind bots, as long as the bots don't interact with people without their consent. Follow bots will be blocked on sight.

        "aboutMore": "\n\nПравила mastodon.ml\nДанный свод правил составлен на основе Устава русскоязычного сегмента Fediverse.\r\nПолностью с Уставом можно ознакомиться здесь: https://github.com/drequivalent/ru-fediverse-policy\r\nНиже приведены выдержки из Устава, относящиеся непосредственно к пользователям mastodon.ml, и особые положения, относящиеся непосредственно к mastodon.ml.\nСоздание учетной записи на данном сервере означает согласие со всеми пунктами данного документа.\nОпределения\n\n\nОбъект\n- сущность в сети Fediverse, указывающая или описывающая типичные фрагменты данных. Объект может быть привязан к Записи, Статье, Изображению, Профилю, Видео, Аудио и другим медиа в зависимости от специфики используемого\nдвижка\nи\nсервера\n. Объект может описывать фрагмент данных как полностью (включая его в себя целиком), так и фрагметарно (например, заголовок и ссылка на видео), но всегда в достатчной мере чтобы обеспечить получатеям доступ к полному объему связвнной с объектом информации. Выражается в виде документов в формате JSON, содержащих информацию о данных.\n\nАктор\n- механизм публикации и подписки в рамках Fediverse, сущность, издающая\nобъекты\n, и производящая над ними\nактивности\n. Как правило, имеет объект класса \"Профиль\", которым описывается.\n\nАктивность\n- сообщение, описывающее взаимодействие. Стандарт определяет такие виды активности, как Создание, Обновление, Удаление, Подписка, Блокировка, Принятие, Отказ, Добавление, Одобрение (так же известно как Лайк), Отмена и Объявление (реблог, перепубликация материала)\n\n\nСоциальный Движок\n/\nДвижок\n- программа или программный комплекс, реализующий\nпротоколы совместимости с Fediverse\n, представление\nобъектов\n, отправку и прием\nактивностей\n.\n\n\n\nСервер\n/\nНода\n/\nИнстанция\n/\nИнстанс\n- совместимая с Fediverse действующая компьютерная система, выполняющая копию\nдвижка\n. Как правило, работает в непрерывном режиме.\n\nПользователь\n- лицо, организация или, в некоторых случаях, автоматизированная система, использующая\nсервер Fediverse\nдля выполнения конкретной функции.\n\n\nУчетная запись\n/\nАккаунт\n- информация о пользователе в базе данных\nсервера\n, дающая ему право на использование ресурсов сети для выполнения конкретной функции.\n\nАдминистративный персонал\n- лица, обеспечивающие поддержку сервера. Состоят из\nадминистраторов\nи\nмодераторов\n.\n\nАдминистратор\n- лицо, осуществляющее\nтехническое обеспечение\n(создание, настройку, обслуживание, вывод из эксплуатации)\nсервера\n. Имеет полномочия\nповышать в правах\nучетные записи\nотдельных\nпользователей\n. Должность администратора почти всегда сопряжена с должностью\nмодератора\n.\n\nМодератор\n- лицо, осуществляющее\nобработку и реагирование на жалобы\nи поддержание дружественной атмосферы в сообществе, имеет полномочия\nпонижать в правах\nучетные записи\nотдельных\nпользователей\n.\n\nСтруктура администраторов\n- собирательное название всех\nадминистраторов\n, входящих в сеть, вне зависимости от\nсервера\n. Иногда к ним причисляются так же и\nмодераторы\n\n\nРетранслятор\n/\nРелей\n- специализированный\nактор\nили\nсервер\nобладающий специализированным актром, который пропускает через себя трафик нескольких серверов в Fediverse.\n\nПроцедуры пользователя\nОсновные процедуры, при помощи которых осуществляется общение пользователей и публикация материалов.\nОзнакомление с Правилами сервера и Уставом сети\nДля лучшего понимания принципов работы сети, избегания и урегулирования конфликтных ситуаций, все пользователи обязаны время от времени перечитывать устав Fediverse в частях \"\nПроцедуры пользователя\n\", \"\nРекомендованные практики\n\" и \"\nУрегулирование конфликтов\n\". Данные части будут приведены в правилах, доступных на каждом сервере, вместе с особыми положениями для каждого индивидуального сервера.\nНовые пользователи должны ознакомиться с уставом до того, как приступить к\nсозданию учетной записи\n.\nОзнакомление с остальными разделами Устава для пользователей факультативно.\nСоздание учетной записи и настройка профиля\nПользователь\nможет создать\nучетную запись\nна любой\nноде\n. Как правило, для создания аккаунта не требуется больше, чем оригинальный никнейм, надежный пароль и адрес электонной почты. При этом, просьба учесть, что IP-адрес, с которого происходит соединение, неизбежно сообщается административному персоналу ноды.\nПосле создания учетной записи, как правило, будет создан соответствующий ей\nактор\n, на который станет возможна подписка других акторов.\nПубликация объекта\nПользователь\nимеет право публиковать на\nноде\nматериалы в зависимости от типа\nдвижка\n, установленного на ноде. При этом, по факту публикации будет создан\nобъект\n, который будет привязан к материалу публикации. Текст объекта будет доступен, чаще всего, по той же ссылке, по которой доступен материал публикации, и издана\nактивность \"Сreate\"\n, указывающая на этот Объект.\nПубликация ответа на объект\nПубликация ответа на уже опубликованный\nобъект\nтехнически ничем не отличается от обычной публикации объекта, кроме поля\nInReplyTo\n, в котором указывается ссылка на объект, ответом на который данный объект является. Таким образом, все объекты, относящиеся к публикациям, равны, и могут быть выстроены принимающими\nсерверами\nв цепочки переписки.\nУпоминание другого актора\nВ\nобъекте\nдопускается занесение ссылок на других\nакторов\nкак тег типа Mention. При этом\nсерверы\nмогут отправить специальное уведомление собственным\nпользователям\n, акторы которых обозначены в этом теге. Интерфейс упоминания других акторов может различаться в зависимости от\nдвижка\n. Как правило, упоминаются все участники текущего обсуждения.\nЛичная корреспонденция\nВ зависимости от движка, у\nпользователя\nесть возможность отправлять личную корреспонденцию. Сообщения, помеченные как \"личные\" видимы только\nупомянутым акторам\n.\nПубликация объектов с предупреждением о контенте\nНекоторые\nдвижки\nдают возможность установить предупреждение о непристойном (в общем смысле известном как NSFW), спорном (например, политическом) или потенциально опасном (шок-контент) для читателя содержимом\nобъекта\n. В таком случае, клиентские приложения должны по умолчанию скрыть содержимое объекта и показывать его только в случае согласия читателя.\nДанный механизм может использоваться не только для сокрытия потенциально опасного содержимого, но и в развлекательных целях или как способ озаглавить объект в тех движках, где богатое форматирование объектов не поддерживается.\nПерепубликация объекта\nПользователь\nимеет право на перепубликацию уже опубликованных\nобъектов\nот имени своего\nактора\nс целью ознакомления своей аудитории с этим объектом, в случае если это позволяется настройками приватности самого объекта. Авторство оригинального объекта при этом сохраняется. По факту перепубликации, актор пользователя издает\nактивность Announce\nв отношении объекта, подлежащего перепубликации, и ссылка на активность попадает в список перепубликаций, привязанный к объекту. Таким образом, при просмотре объекта становится известны ID всех акторов, осуществивших перепубликацию.\nВнимание!\nСам факт перепубликации объекта не обязательно означает его одобрение со стороны пользователя, осуществившего перепубликацию.\nПубликация реакции на объект\nПользователь\nимеет право опубликовать реакцию на материал. В настоящее время в стандарте унифицирована только реакция Одобрения, хотя в зависимости от конкретного движка могут быть варианты. По факту одобрения, актор пользователя издает\nактивность Like\nв отношении\nобъекта\n, подлежащего одобрению, и ссылка на активность попадает в список одобрений, привязанный к объекту. Таким образом, при просмотре объекта становится известны ID всех акторов, осуществивших реакцию.\nУдаление объекта\nПользователь\nимеет право удалить свой собственный\nобъект\n. По факту удаления, актор издает\nактивность Delete\nв отношении объекта, после чего все остальные серверы обязаны удалить ссылки на этот объект и/или копии этого объекта из своих хранилищ данных. Допускается замена исходного объекта на объект\nкласса Tombstone\n.\nБлокировка другого актора\nПользователь\nимеет право отказать другому\nактору\nв коммуникации. Для этого можно воспользоваться опцией блокировки. Блокируемый актор перестанет получать любые сообщения от актора пользователя, а актор пользователя перестанет получать любые сообщения от блокируемого актора. Отказ в коммуникации может быть осуществлен без уведомления в отказе противоположенной стороны.\nГлушение другого актора\nБолее мягким вариантом блокировки является возможность глушения, предоставляющаяся большинством\nдвижков\n. При глушении,\nпользователь\nпросто перестает видеть уведомления о действиях заглушенного актора. Глушение может быть осуществлено без уведомления в отказе противоположенной стороны.\nОтмена реакции, перепубликации или блокировки\nПользователь\nимеет право в силу ряда причин отменить предыдущие активности\nреакции\n,\nперепубликации\nи\nблокировки\n, издав\nактивность Undo\nв отношении этих активностей. Удаленные серверы обязаны при этом отменить все эффекты целевых активностей (снять лайк, удалить перепубликацию, снять блокировку и т.д.).\nОформление жалобы модераторам\nВ случае невозможности самостоятельного\nразрешения конфликтной ситуации\nи необходимости вмешательства\nадминистративного персонала\n, допускается оформление жалобы. Жалобу можно подать как\nмодераторам\nсвоего сервера, так и модераторам сервера нарушителя, в случае если нарушитель приписан к удаленному серверу. Большинство движков предлагают специализированный интерфейс для оформления жалоб модераторам как собственного, так и удаленного сервера. В случае если подобный специализированного интерфейс отсутствует, допкскается оформление жалобы прямым сообщением или средствами вне сети Fediverse.\nПереход на другой сервер\nПользователь\nимеет право сменить\nсервер\n, которым пользуется. Большинство движков предоставляют для этого возможность экспорта и импорта пользовательских данных, а также указания местоположения\nактора\nнового\nаккаунта\n.\nЗакрытие учетной записи\nПользователь\nимеет право удалить все свои данные с\nсервера\n, и погасить\nучетную запись\n. Большинство\nдвижков\nпредоставляют возможность закрытия аккаунта самим пользователем.\r\nКак правило, полное удаление аккаунта не поддерживается в целях избегания\nимперсонации\n.\nРекомендованные практики для пользователей\nДанные практики рекомендуются\nпользователям\nдля поддержания этичного общения и улучшения качества жизни в сети.\nПринципы неагрессивного поведения\nКак\nпользователь\nFediverse, свободной сети социального общения, в целом, вы можете делать все, что пожелаете в тех пределах, которые вам позволяют правила вашего\nсервера\n, правила серверов пользователей, с которыми идет переписка и лично\nадминистративный персонал\nвашего сервера. В общих чертах, для поддержания дружеского климата общения и избегания конфликтов, необходимо придерживаться трех правил:\n\nНе будь некорректным по отношению к другим\nНе раздражайся слишком легко из-за некорректного поведения по отношению к себе\nНе делай другим того, чего не желаешь себе самому\n\nДругими словами, каких-либо строгих правил не существует, однако ожидается вежливое поведение.\nСвоевременная настройка профилей\nПосле создания\nучетной записи\nрекомендуется немедленно заполнить профиль. Желательно, чтобы информация в профиле была осмыслена и дескриптивна. Это даст\nмодераторам\nпонять, что за учетной записью стоит живой человек, а не потенциально\nнежелательная автоматизированная система\n.\nОзнакомление с особыми положениями сервера\nИногда для бесконфликтного общения на каком-либо\nсервере\nнедостаточно знать только общие положения устава. У некоторых серверов могут быть особые положения в отношении административных, модераторских процедур или\nконтентной политики\n. Настоятельно рекомендуется регулярно ознакамливаться с правилами сервера, на котором вы зарегистрированы. Дополнительно, поощряется ознакомление с правилами других серверов. Вполне возможно, вы пожелаете мигрировать.\nПредупреждения о чувствительном материале\nМногие\nсоциальные движки\nпозволяют скрыть содержимое поста до того момента, как читатель сознательно выберет увидеть содержимое.\nПодобное скрытие\nсопровождается текстовым описанием скрытого содержимого.\nДанная функция позволяет читателям сделать осознанный выбор просматривать или не просматривать контент, который они, возможно, не хотели бы увидеть или не хотели бы быть замечены за его просмотром. Главным образом, это откровенный сексуальный контент, контент связанный с насилием, контент, связанный с психоактивными веществами, спорный контент политического характера, спойлеры к произведениям, и тому подобные темы.\nПри публикации материала с предупреждением, хорошим тоном является описание предупреждения, наиболее точно передающее суть скрытого контента. Если чувствительный контент опубликован с явным, понятным и дескриптивным предупреждением, за последствия просмотра этого контента для себя и окружающих ответственен сам читатель, жалобы связанные с публикацией такого контента, как правило, будут разрешены в пользу опубликовавшего.\nАктивное участие в жизни сети\nВвиду своей технической организации, Fediverse не имеет эффективных механизмов автоматического нахождения и предложения новым\nпользователям\nинтересных лент для подписки. Если вы новый пользователь, то для того, чтобы сеть раскрылась для вас в полной мере, чтобы находить интересных людей и чтобы люди находили вас, придется потрудиться больше, чем это могло бы быть в централизованных социальных сетях. Пишите больше о том, что вам нравится или о том, что вас волнует. Встревайте в любые диалоги, которые вас хотя бы немного заинтересовали. Отыскивайте новичков и помогайте им освоиться. Не гнушайтесь спросить совета сами, вам обязательно помогут. Не забывайте, взаимопомощь выгодна и для вас, и для сети в целом. Вы делаете свою ленту более заметной, а сеть пополняется вашими материалами. Много отличных мыслей приходят когда вы отвечаете кому-то, ведете с кем-то диалог.\nФинансирование сети\nFediverse - добровольная, в основном любительская сеть. Это значит, что люди, которые администрируют, модерируют и в целом\nобслуживают эту сеть\n, тратят на нее свое свободное время. Обслуживание инфраструктуры и модерирование диспутов - это огромный интеллектуальный, моральный, а порой и физический труд. У Fediverse нет и не может быть общего фонда, в который можно отправлять пожертвования, поэтому многие администраторы имеют способы прямой финансовой поддержки. Как правило, это - сервисы регулярных микроплатежей вроде Patreon или Liberapay. Поддерживайте администраторов и модераторов, своих или просто тех, кто вам понравится. Если\nадминистративный персонал\nтаких способов поддержки не предоставляет, не стесняйтесь спросить, нужна ли помощь.\nСвободная миграция\nFediverse - это единое пространство. Каждый\nсервер\nздесь способен общаться со всеми остальными серверами (за исключением случаев блокировки, безусловно). Каким сервером или каким\nдвижком\nвы будете пользоваться - зависит всецело только от вас. Если вас не устраивают правила вашего сервера, или\nадминистративный состав\n, или местные\nпользователи\n- смело переходите на другой сервер. Если вас не устраивают ограничения вашего движка, не задумываясь переходите на другой движок. Все ваши подписчики смогут подписаться на ваш новый профиль, где бы он ни оказался.\nПоощрение вступления в сеть новых пользователей\nКак любой инструмент социального взаимодействия, Fediverse не может существовать без своих\nпользователей\n. Поэтому, поощряется распространение информации о сети среди друзей и знакомых. Если вы пришли сюда сами - приведите своих товарищей. Это важно для роста и развития сети, чем больше людей ей будет пользоваться, тем лучше, функциональнее и удобнее она будет становиться впоследствии. Если ваши друзья испытывают трудности в использовании сети, обязательно помогайте им и отвечайте на их вопросы. Будьте терпеливы и приветливы к новичкам. Обязательно ознакамливайте их с текстом этого раздела.\nУрегулирование конфликтов\nСообщество сети Fediverse подчиняется\nпринципам неагрессивного поведения\n. Однако, это не гарантирует от возникноверия конфликтов. В любом конфликте обсуждается вина каждой стороны, и административные меры могут быть приняты против любой из них или обеих, на усмотрение административного персонала.\nПервый шаг в урегулировании любого конфликта между пользователями - попытка пользователей связаться напрямую, к примеру, через\nличные сообщения\nили по другим каналам связи. Вполне возможно, конфликт можно решить либо полюбовно, либо простой взаимной блокировкой. Если, подавая жалобу, вы упустили этот основной этап, ваша жалоба не будет рассматриваться.\nВторой шаг - процедура\nподачи жалобы модераторам\n. Жалобы должны сопровождаться убедительными доказательствами, обычно копиями сообщений. Голословные жалобы не рассматриваются.\nАдминистративный персонал сервера не обязан отслеживать весь материал, публикуемый пользователями. Поэтому правила не могут применяться ко всем публикациям и активностям. Персонал может и должен реагировать на жалобы от пользователей, и поступать в отношении нарушителей по собственному усмотрению (например,\nвыносить предупреждения\nили\nпонижать нарушителей в правах\n) в зависимости от тяжести нарушения.\nПолитика структуры администраторов основана на взаимном доверии и убежденности в соблюдении общего блага всех участников сети. В случае некорректного поведения административного состава сервера в отношении пользователя, пользователь обязан публично заявить о нарушении таким образом, чтобы администраторы других серверов могли быть оповещены. В случае если нарушение происходит со стороны локального административного состава, желательно предварительно произвести процедуру\nмиграции учетной записи\nна другой сервер (обязательно с публикацией нового местоположения со стороны старой учетной записи как доказательства), поскольку в случае серьезного нарушения и, как результат, подрыва доверия со стороны других администраторов, к серверу-нарушителю могут быть применены\nадминистративные меры\nвплоть до блокировки другими администраторами.\nНекорректное поведение\nВ этом документе встречаются ссылки на \"чрезмерно некорректное поведение\". Этот термин трудно поддается определению, поскольку он основан на мнениях\nструктуры администраторов\n. В общих словах, некорректное поведение раздражает, беспокоит или вредит кому-то другому. Не обязательно нарушать правила, чтобы вести себя некорректно по отношению к другим.\r\nСуществует разница между просто некорректным поведением и чрезмерно некорректным. Редкому пользователю сети удается не вести себя некорректно. Чаще всего, только после того, как такое поведение продолжается даже после предупреждения, оно становится чрезмерно некорректным. Это не значит, что вы ведете себя некорректно только после повторения какого-либо действия (например,\nумышленная имперсонация\nявляется чрезмерно некорректной с самой первой попытки, такое поведение описывается как недопустимое), однако показывает, что некая толерантность должна быть проявлена.\r\nС другой стороны, не следует ожидать, что\nподавая жалобу\nна некорректное поведение другого участника сети, вы гарантируете себе разрешение конфликта в вашу пользу. Сеть состоит из множества разнообразных сообществ, и нормы поведения в разных сообществах различаются. В разных сообществах одно и тоже поведение носит разную степень допустимости.\r\nОтветственность за определение чрезмерно некорректного поведения лежит на структуре администраторов и модерирующем персонале. В данном документе определение намеренно дано недостаточно конкретно, чтобы обеспечить ту степень свободы, которая необходима им для соответствия нуждам растущего и меняющегося сообщества.\nНекорректное поведение пользователя\nНиже приведен список иллюстрирующих примеров поведения пользователей сети, которые являются раздражающими или недопустимыми. Многие из них не являются строгими запретами, однако уже являются серьезными поводами для подачи жалобы административному составу.\nОскорбительное поведение\nОскорбительным поведением считаются любые попытки преследования, угроз, запугивания, пожелания серьезного вреда здоровью, необоснованная агрессия, сексуальные домогательства, оскорбления на почве лчиных характеристик (национальности, цвета кожи/глаз/волос, сексуальности, пола, роста, других врожденных/неизменных качеств), и т.д. Подобное поведение может явиться поводом для административных действий, направленных на\nпонижение прав пользователя\n, вплоть до погашения учетной записи.\nРазмещение коммерческих сообщений\nРазмещение одиночных личных коммерческих сообщений, в целом, является допустимым. Если\nпользователь\nжелает купить или продать какие-то товары или же получить или предоставить какие-либо услуги своим друзьям или другим пользователям сети - у них должна быть возможность это сделать. Однако, создание\nаккаунтов\n, одной единственной целью которых является распространение рекламных сообщений (проще говоря, спам), является раздражающим поведением, и на\nсерверах\nсо свободным доступом является некорректным. Подобное поведение допустимо, однако, на серверах, принадлежащих коммерческим компаниям.\nИмперсонация\nНедопустимой считается эффективная выдача себя за другого\nпользователя\nсети - имитация его адреса, ника, аватара, стиля общения - с целью опорочить этого человека, или произвести мошеннические действия. Подобное поведение недопустимо, и является поводом для немедленного\nпонижения в правах\nвплоть до погашения и закрытия учетной записи.\nТроллинг\nУмышленная провокация конфликта или выведение других\nпользователей\nиз себя является самым классическим примером раздражающего поведения (поскольку имеет целью, собственно, вызвать раздражение у окружающих), и его следует избегать.\nАвтоматизированные активности\nАвтоматическая публикация материалов считается допустимой, если до сведения других\nпользователей\nдоведено, что работает автоматическая система. Некоторые\nдвижки\nпредоставляют возможность извещения других пользователей о том, что актор является ботом. В противном случае, автоматизированные рассылки материалов и активностей (например, накрутка лайков и репостов) считается раздражающим поведением.\nПубликация материала, защищенного авторским правом\nВ сети Fediverse приветствуется публикация свободного материала и развитие свободной культуры. Публикация материала, защищенного авторским правом допускается в двух случаях: либо если вы - полноправный владелец этого материала и вы имеете право выкладывать его в свободный доступ, либо если материал публикуется на условиях добросовестного использования (а именно, в информационных, научных, учебных или культурных целях). Пиратство не поощряется.\nПубликация материала, противоречащего законодательству\nСтрого запрещается публикация материала, противоречащего действующему законодательству той страны, в чьей юрисдикции расположен\nсервер\n. К примеру, материал, содержащий детскую порнографию должен быть удален с сервера сразу после обнаружения.\nПубликация материала, содержащего вредооносное ПО\nПубликация материалов, содержащих вредоносное ПО - вирусы, черви, трояны, блокировщики, XSS-скрипты, ссылки на фишинг-сайты, и тому подобное, является недопустимой. Пользователям рекомендуется проверять публикуемые материалы на наличие вредоносного ПО.\nСпам жалобами\nРассмотрение формальной жалобы\n- это действие, к которому не следует легкомысленно относиться. Расследование и принятие мер по жалобе требует времени и энергии, которое\nадминистраторы\nпредпочли бы потратить на более конструктивную деятельность. Настойчивая отправка большого количества мелких жалоб, в особености без попытки самостоятельного урегулирования конфликта, и в особенности без доказательств, является раздражающей.\nНекорректное поведение административного персонала\nНиже приведено несколько иллюстрирующих примеров поведения администраторов и модераторов сети, которые являются раздражающими или недопустимыми.\nНеработоспособность сервера\nЕсли\nсервер\nнеобходимо остановить в целях технического обслуживания, хорошим тоном является предупреждение\nпользователей\nсервера. Главным образом это производится через учетную запись администратора. Также, в некоторых движках может быть предусмотрен механизм административного оповещения пользователей. Частая неработоспособность сервера без предупреждения и без объяснения причин является некорректным поведением.\nСохранение удаляемых объектов\nВ ответ на\nактивность Delete\n, изданную владельцем объекта, сервер обязан удалить данные связанного с активностью объекта. Удержание чужих данных, подвергающихся удалению, недопустимо. Если\nсервер\nзамечен в сохранении данных удаляемых объектов,\nадминистраторы\nдолжны как можно скорее исправить эту ситуацию.\nРаскрытие персональных данных и личной корреспонденции\nРаскрытие персональных данных о\nпользователе\n(как то фамилия, имя и отчество, год рождения, место проживания, место учебы или работы, текущее местоположение) по инициативе\nадминистративного персонала\nявляется грубейшим нарушением приватности пользователя, и серьезно подрывает доверие пользователей сети и других администраторов к вам лично и к вашему серверу в целом. Подобное поведение является недопустимым.\r\nТо же самое касается и\nличной корреспонденции\nпользователей. Раскрытие или использование в любой форме информации, содержащейся в личных сообщениях, не адресованных вам и не написанных вами, считается некорректным поведением, если сообщения не были переданы как часть\nформальной жалобы\n.\nПрочие моменты\nОтказ администраторов от ответственности за оконечно-зашифрованный трафик\nАдминистративный персонал\nсервера принципиально не может нести ответственность за сообщения, которые они физически не в состоянии прочитать. Безусловно, если вскрывается грубое нарушение со стороны\nпользователей\n, использовавших до этого момента end-to-end-шифрование, к нарушителям должны быть\nприменены меры\n, однако в силу невозможности узнать намерения нарушителей заранее, административный персонал не может считаться сопричастным к нарушению.\nСвобода слова и удализм\nСерверы\nмогут различаться в своих специальных политиках.\nАдминистрация\nнекоторых серверов может разрешать любой контент, ссылаясь на право\nпользователей\nна свободу слова и самовыражения. Администрация других серверов, однако, может жестко пресекать попытки обсуждения каких бы то ни было неприемлемых по их мнению тем. И на то, и на другое администрация каждого конкретного сервера имеет право. Удализм не является цензурой по двум причинам:\n1) Сервер Fediverse - не СМИ. Администрация по умолчанию лично вам ничем не обязана, в случае если сама администрация не указывает обратного. Администрация свободна не являться проводником вашего мнения абсолютно так же как вы свободны ваше мнение выражать;\r\n2) Если вам указали на то, что на данном сервере некоторые темы строго запрещены, вы имеете возможность мигрировать на другой сервер или зарегистрировать запасную учетную запись на сервере, где такого запрета нет. Внимательно изучайте особые положения правил серверов.\nЕсли вы являетесь\nадминистратором\nсервера со свободным доступом без ограничений, убедительно рекомендуется явным образом обозначить данную политику в особых положениях вашего сервера.\nОсобые положения\nНиже приведена информация об особенностях данного сервера, которые необходимо иметь в виду. Данный раздел заполняется администратором, и может содержать технические подробности сервера, и особенности модерационной политики. Данный раздел постоянно дорабатывается администратором, пожтому предписывается время от времени перечитывать его.\nТехнические особенности\n\nДвижок\n: Mastodon\nТип публикуемых объектов\n: Note\n\nОграничение объема\n: 1000 знаков\nМодерационная политика\n\nОсновной язык ноды - русский. Допускаются посты на других языках.\nЕсли учетная запись не подает признаков живого пользователя (как правило, наличие аватара и заполненного профиля, а также ответ на вопрос в личных сообщениях сразу после регистрации), запись подлежит полному погашению.\nУ ноды нет четко определенной тематики.\nПропаганда ненависти и предрассудков не поощряется.\n\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

Failure to do so will result in either being silenced or suspended.\n\nInvitations\nOn August 15, 2019, we made the decision to go invite-only. This decision may be temporary, or it may be permanent.

We highly encourage users to invite people they know or people that may be interested in joining our community.\nIf you're looking to join\nsocial.privacytools.io\nand don't know any existing users, that's fine too! Send an email to support@privacytools.io and maybe include a quick message about why you'd like to join this instance.

But another reason is just to keep this community small. Limiting registrations will help keep the quality of our conversations up. Not everything is about the user count!\nCan I share invites publicly?\nUse your best judgement. If you want to send an invite to a group, forum, chat room, subreddit, etc. that's totally fine! We do ask that you either time-limit your invitation, or set a maximum number of uses for invitations you post publicly. There's options to do that on the invite creation page.\nI don't want to wait for an invite.\nThe beauty of Mastodon is federation: A user on one instance can interact with a user on another!

This means we have to stack up hardware if we would expect more users. Since our services are free and don't use any tracking or advertisement mechanisms we greatly appreciate donations if you like.\n\n⚙️ Services\nA current list of services is below.\n\nThis Mastodon instance\nkoyu.space Mail\nkoyu.space Jitsi\nkoyu.space Discuss (Forum)\nSengi (Lightweight fediverse client)\nkoyu.space Minecraft\nIRC server at irc.koyu.space\n\nServices with closed registrations are request-only due to limited resources.\nWe also offer free subdomains for users on koyu.space! Just e-mail us your A record or CNAME record along with your preffered subdomain and we will handle the rest. Please note that we don't take any responsibility for user subdomains except limited by law. We may also allow you to have a free @koyu.space e-mail address depending on how many slots we have free to use.\n\n📜 Rules\nAs of\n17/11/2020\n💭 General\n\nRespect other users and their backgrounds.\nHere are some examples of\r\n        activities that will not be tolerated:\nHarassment.\nHateful speech.\nBeing transphobic, racist, fascist, or supporting any oppressions in general.\nJokes about suicide, self harm.\n...And potentially more as we encounter specific cases, but you see the picture.\n\nWhen interacting with\nusers outside of this community\n, you\nhave\nto follow the rules of their community.\nFor the majority\r\n        of cases, following our set of rules should be sufficient.\nDon't share anyone's personal information without their consent, and delete\r\n        content about a person should they ask.\nFor profit companies accounts aren't allowed.\n(If you look around a bit there are communities made specifically for this)\nOffering sex services is prohibited in this community.\n(If you look around a bit there are communities made specifically for this)\n\nBoosting\ncontent is considered the\nsame as posting\ncontent. If you boost\r\n        something, you can be held responsible.\nIf you misbehave somewhere else, we reserve the right to sanction you\r\n        locally.\nDon't go on a crusade against those who don't respect our local rules,\r\n        people from other communities have no obligation to follow ours.\n\nIf you don't like to see the content of these people, you can block or\r\n                silence them.\nIf you think that a community is nothing more than a source of nuisance,\r\n                please\ncontact me\n.\n\n\n💬 Posting\n\nIt is mandatory to put under\nCW\nthe following topics, if\r\n        posted in\nPublic\ntimelines:\n\nSpoilers.\nIf you're not sure what a spoiler is,\nhere's the Wikipedia article about it\n\nStrong negativity.\nMany of us are already having a hard time. It's hard to come across\r\n                negative content when you don't want to.\n\nViolences.\nAnything that seems violent to you. From a fictional murder description\r\n                to a video of police violence.\n\nPolitics.\nThe depressing state of current politics is not to everyone's liking\r\n                when they come here to relax.\n\nScary Bugs.\nHonestly, who likes close-up photos of spiders?\n\nPerson(s) close to / looking at the camera.\nMany of us are uncomfortable when we observe them, proximity with\r\n                others, etc.\n\nIt is recommended to put the linked posts in the same thread.\nIntegrate as much content as possible in the same message if it is\r\n                linked. We have a larger character limit than most Mastodon communities,\r\n                so take advantage of this.\n\nSpamming is of course not allowed.\n\n🖼️ Attachments\n\nYou have to follow proper procedures when posting\nNSFW\ncontent.\nIf you don't understand what NSFW means,\nhere's the Wikipedia article about it\n.\nYou\nmust\nhide NSFW content using the\nMark media as sensitive\ncheckbox\nYou\nmust\nput explicit (Pornographic, genitals, fluid\r\n                everywhere, etc) content on the\nUnlisted\nor\nFollowers-only\nprivacy level. Anything but\nPublic\n.\nYou\nmay not\nhave NSFW content in your profiles.\n\nIf you are posting a media with\nPublic\nprivacy level, be sure to include a description for the visually or hearing\r\n        impaired.\nTo do that, use the\nedit\nbutton when the media is uploaded.\nThe description\nmust\nfollows\nWikipedia's\r\n                    guidelines.\n(It's also a good guide if you're afraid of not doing it right.)\n\nYou have to try pineapple pizza. It's great.\nSexual depictions of minors (drawings included) are not allowed and are\r\n        considered like pedopornography.\n\nThis same rule applies if it is your body, you have to be at least 18\r\n                years old to post sexually implying pictures of yourself, no exceptions.\n\n\n😀 Fediverse Friendly Moderation Covenant\nThis instance commits to the following\n1. Administration and Moderation will be handled as neutral as possible\nReports and widespread information on specific instances (often known as\nbad actors\n) will be verified\r\nand actions might be taken as necessary.\n2. Actions taken will respond to the bare minimum to keep the network operating and not influence the ability of the instances users to connect to other people\n\nIf another instance spreads media content of questionable legality for the region the current instance\r\nis operating from, these\nfiles might be rejected\nfrom being saved.\nIf another instance is sharing hateful messages that impact local users, there might be consideration\r\nof\nsilencing\nthat specific instance from being visible in timelines. If users follow and/or wish to follow\r\nusers on the target instance, they are still free to do so.\nIf another instance is posting content illegal in the local instance operation region or actively posts content\r\nattacking local users, a full\ninstance block\nmight be the last resort.\n\n3. Communication before Actions\nIf any of the above behaviours start to surface from a given instance, the moderation of the local instance will attempt\r\nto inform the moderation/administration of that instance and resolve the problems coming from there. Only if no communication succeeded or no results that resolved issues came forth, actions will be taken towards that instance.\n4. We won't recommend blocks\nBlocklists and block recommendations as an information source are taken for granted but lack accurate verification. Instead of using these options to publicly announce instances of questionable intent, we will inform local users of such, with the reminder of possible personal options for hiding content that might impact their experience of the network.\n5. No Guilt-by-Association/Federation\nIf we have applied any action against Instance X, an Instance Y that federates with them will not get the same judgement applied to them.

However, most instances with similar cultures to the instance run\nPleroma\n, which, while it is good software, has some different features from Mastodon.  This instance was set up to provide a community similar to that of Niu, with a similar moderation policy, federation policy, and type of content.\nAnyone is welcome, as long as you follow some simple rules.  Mods here err on the side of caution, when making moderation decisions - you can rest assured that you will not be banned for making a post when you're in a bad mood or feeling edgy, for example.\nThe Rules\n\nRespect other users and their backgrounds. Examples of some activities that will not be tolerated are:\nHarassment.\nHateful speech.\nBeing transphobic, racist, fascist, religious intolerance, etc...\n(And potentially more as we come across specific cases, but you see the picture)\n\nWhen interacting with\nusers outside of this server\n, you\nshould\nfollow the rules of their server.  In some cases this is unreasonable, depending on the server's policies, but please try to be courteous.\nYou have to follow proper procedures when posting NSFW content.\nIf you don't understand what NSFW means,\nhere's the wikipedia article about it\n.\nYou\nmust\nhide NSFW content using the\nMark media as sensitive\ncheckbox\nYou\nmust\nput explicit (Pornographic, genitals, fluid everywhere, etc) content on the\nUnlisted\nprivacy level, or more.\nYou\nmay not\nhave NSFW content in your profiles.\nGore content must be posted on followers-only and must not be posted for shock value (personal injuries or medical information are allowed, of course).\n\nSexual depictions of children are not allowed on this server and are considered child pornography and reported to the relevant authorities.\nThis same rule applies if it is your body, you have to be at least 18 years old to post sexually implying pictures of yourself, no exceptions.\nLolicon is allowed, but must be marked as\nUnlisted\nand NSFW, and should not be posted mentioning users on instances that do not allow such content.\nDon't share anyone's personal information without their consent, and delete content about a person should they ask.\nFor profit companies account aren't allowed. (If you look around a bit there are servers made specifically for this)\nOffering sex services in exchange for money is prohibited on the server. (If you look around a bit there are servers made specifically for this)\n\nBoosting\ncontent is the\nsame as posting\ncontent, if you boost something you endorse it and it must follow these rules.\n\nArt reposting:\nposting art from outside the Fediverse is a common practice on the Fediverse.  Since many artists view it as stealing, it's a controversial issue.  If you do repost off-Fediverse art, please be sure to link to the source - and don't repost art that the creator has put on the Fediverse, you can boost it instead.\n\nPolitics With Other Instances\n\"Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive.\" - Netiquette\nWe federate with the whole fediverse.\nThat being said, instances that are a common source of\ncontent that breaks our rules\n, or are a\nsource of nuisance\nmight be either:\n\nSilenced\n, where anyone can follow anyone, but posts will be hidden by default.\n\nSuspended\n, which prevents almost all communication with this instance.\nThis list is documented at the bottom of the page.\nIf you're managing a server and believe we have silenced or suspended you unfairly, please reach out to the administration team via a non-suspended instance.\n\nOther Instances we Recommend\nIf the rules on this instance do not suit you, we recommend you find another.\nThere is a curated list located at\nwowana.me/fediverse.xht\n(for instances with some level of \"freedom of expression\", that we recommend (we currently federate with all instances on that list, so you can interact with users here from any of those instances).\nGuidelines\nYou won't be banned for violating these, but the community would appreciate if you did.\nDon't spam the local timeline, especially with NSFW imagery.\nDon't ask strangers to \"add a cw\" to their posts - usually, muting or blocking is recommended.\nDon't censor slurs - it bypasses word filters and is annoying to readers.\n\nCredits\n\nEmoji\n\nblobcats\n: unknown/various artists\n\nblobfoxes\n:\nFeuerfuchs\n\nveemojis\n:\nlottev\n\nVarious theming elements (such as banner, logo, etc) also donated by\nlottev\n\n\nRules inspired by\nniu.moe\n.\nSoftware:\nBlobcatstodon\nwhich is a fork of\nglitch-soc\nwhich is a fork of\nMastodon\n\nUnavailable content\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

The full list is below. Contact a moderator if you wish to dispute an entry.\nRules\n\nNo commercial accounts, advertising, or excessive promotion\nNo bots, unless they’re cute, funny, or useful. Bots should avoid posting to the public timeline.\nNo gore or graphic violence\nContent that is borderline NSFW or could be construed as NSFW at a glance should be put behind a CW (Content Warning)\nNo racism\nNo sexism\nNo discrimination based on gender, sexual minority, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or national origin\nNo xenophobia or violent nationalism\nNo sexual depictions of children\nNo holocaust denialism, Nazi symbolism, promotion of National Socialism, or anything that is illegal in the European Union\nNo stalking or harassment\nNo fake accounts unless they are clearly labeled as such\nNo solicitation of prostitution\n\nHandling harassment\nIf you are being harassed, please report the user using the “…” button and then “Report.” For urgent concerns, please DM a moderator.\nIf you engage in harassing behavior, the moderator may take any action they deem appropriate, such as a warning or an expulsion.\nThe above rules may change at any time, and you may be banned at any time based on the moderators’ judgment.\nPrivacy policy\nWhat will we do with your data? Nothing. How will you be influenced by advertisers? You won’t; brands and non-humans (other than fun/useful bots) are banned.

If this is not okay with you, this might not be the instance for you.\nAlso, for truly private data sent between two people, Mastodon offers no E2E encryption.

        "aboutMore": "\n\nPrésentation\nPresentation\nEquestria Social Network (Abrégé EQS, aussi appelé par son nom de domaine Equestria.Social) est une instance (Ou \"serveur\" si vous préférez) Mastodon, en ligne depuis le 8 mai 2017 par Baroriam. Elle fait ainsi partie du \"fediverse\", c'est à dire de l'ensemble des réseaux sociaux utilisant les mêmes standards que Mastodon (OStatus et/ou ActivityPub), comme GNU Social par exemple. Tout comme l'E-Mail, vous pouvez interagir avec n'importe qui dans ce réseau de réseaux.\nEquestria Social Network (EQS abstract, also called by its domain name Equestria.Social) is a Mastodon instance (Or \"server\" if you prefer), that is online since May 8, 2017 by Baroriam. Thus it is part of the fediverse, which is all of the social networks using the same standards as Mastodon (OStatus and/or ActivityPub), like GNU Social for example. Just like E-Mail, you can interact with any one in this network of social networks.\n\nRègles de base\nBasic rules\nIl faut bien des règles pour que tout le monde s'entende : Le mot d'ordre général est de\nrespecter autrui\n, et de garder du bon sens. L'expression \"\nDon't be a d*ck\n\" semble appropriée pour résumer ces règles.\nIt is a necessary to have rules so that everyone gets along : The general watchword is to\nrespect others\n, and to keep common sense. The phrase \"\nDo not be a d*ck\n\" seems appropriate to summarize these rules.\nCe qui est interdit :\nWhat is prohibited :\n\nTout message illégal vis à vis de la législation française et plus généralement européenne. Attention, chaque utilisateur est responsable devant la loi de ce qu'il poste. De plus, les URLs menant vers du contenu illégal sont aussi interdits.\nAny message illegal to french legislation and more generally european. Warning, each user is legislatively responsible of his posts. Moreover, URLs leading to illegal content are also prohibited.\nTout message raciste, xénophobe... etc...\nAny racist, xenophobic... etc... message.\nTout harcèlement envers une ou plusieurs personnes.\nAny harassment against one or more persons.\n\nTout flood ou spam sur le serveur et/ou sur un utilisateur,\néviter aussi le shitposting intense et/ou oppressif dans les fils publiques\n.\nAny flood or spam on the server and/or on a user,\nalso avoid intense and/or oppresive shitposting in public timelines\n.\nTout compte à but exclusivement publicitaire.\nAny account for exclusively advertising purposes.\nTout contenu jugé comme propagande.\nAny content judged as propaganda.\nTout robot mentionnant automatique une personne qui n'a rien demandé.\nAny robot mentioning automatically a person who did not ask anything.\n\nCe qui est autorisé sous conditions :\nWhat is allowed under conditions :\n\nTout contenu sexuel ou à connotation sexuel, c'est à dire de la nudité à la pornographie (Excepté ce qui est mentionné comme interdit, donc pas de lolicon par exemple).\nAny sexual or with sexual connotation, that is from nudity to pornography (Except what is mentioned as prohibited, so no lolicon for example).\nPlus généralement, tout contenu pouvant heurter la sensibilité d'un jeune publique.\nMore generally, any content that may offend the sensitivity of a young public.\n\nConditions pour poster du contenu toléré :\nConditions for posting tolerated content :\n\nMettre un \"Content Warning\" qui indique explicitement le type de contenu :\nCW\n\nPut a \"Content Warning\" that explicitly indicates the type of content :\nCW\n\nActiver la marque \"Sensible\" pour les médias :\n\nEnable the \"Sensitive\" mark for medias :\n\nNe pas en mettre dans du contenu publique, comme par exemple la photo de profile.\nDo not put it in public content, such as profile picture.\n\nRemarques importantes sur ce genre de contenu :\nImportant notes on this kind of content :\n\nSi vous ne souhaitez pas voir ce genre de contenu posté par un compte spécifique, vous pouvez vous même le Masquer ou le Bloquer de vos Fils Publiques.\nIf you do not want to see the kind of content posted by a specific account, you can even hide it or block it from your Public Timelines.\nIl est important de ne pas envahir les Fils Publiques (Local et Global) avec ce genre de contenu. Merci donc d'utiliser le plus souvent possible une \"Confidentialité\" plus restreinte pour éviter de les envahir, comme par exemple le mode \"Non listé\" :\n\nIt is important not to invade the (Local and Global) Public Timelines with this kind of content. So please use a more restricted \"Privacy\" as often as possible to avoid invading them ,as for example the \"Unlisted\" mode :\n\n\nCe qui est autorisé :\nWhat is allowed :\n\nTout ce qui n'est pas interdit ci-dessus, tant que vous respectez les autres utilisateurs.\nAll that is not prohibited above, as long as you respect other users.\nTout avis et opinion (Avec si possible un \"Content Warning\" si jamais il est trop tabou, afin d'éviter des problèmes).\nAny opinion and opinion (If possible with a \"Content Warning\" if it is too taboo, in order to avoid problems).\nLes spoilers, mais avec un \"Content Warning\" :\nCW\n\nSpoilers, but with a \"Content Warning\" :\nCW\n\nLes comptes parodiques, mais avec précision que celui-ci est un compte parodique.\nThe parodics accounts, but with precision that this one is a parody account.\nLes robots qui postent modérément du contenu et mentionnent des utilisateurs uniquement si ils l'ont demandé.\nRobots who moderately post content and mention users only if they have requested it.\n\nChaque utilisateur s'engage à respecter la liberté d'expression des autres, mais aussi de ne pas en abuser, afin, encore une fois, de respecter autrui.\nEach user agrees to respect the freedom of expression of others, but also not to abuse it, so as, once again, to respect others.\n\nModération\nModeration\nModération par les utilisateurs\nModeration by the users\nL'utilisateur est le premier modérateur du contenu qu'il reçoit. N'importe qui peut Silencer ou Bloquer un autre utilisateur si jamais il ne souhaite pas voir ses postes.\nThe user is the first moderator of the content he receives. Anyone can Mute or Block another user if he does not want to see his posts.\nDe plus, n'importe qui peut signaler à l'équipe de modération un message ou un utilisateur qui peut être hors des limites définies par les règles de l'instance.\nN'hésitez donc pas à signaler les messages qui vous sembles en dehors des règles inscrites ci-dessus.\nMoreover, anyone can report to the moderation team a message or user that may be outside the limits defined by the rules of the instance.\nSo, do not hesitate to post messages that you think are outside of the rules listed above.\n\nModération par EQS\nModeration by EQS\n\nLa liberté d'expression étant un droit fondamental pour l'être humain, nous pensons qu'il est important de laisser passer le plus de messages possibles, c'est à dire le plus d'avis et d'opinions possibles. Néanmoins, il faut des limites, qui sont inscrites dans les Règles ci-dessus.\nFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right, we believe that it is important to let as many messages as possible, ie the most opinions and opinions possible. Nevertheless, there are limits, which are set out in the above Rules.\nC'est ainsi que nous nous efforçons de mettre nos opinions de coté et de réfléchir à plusieurs afin de maintenir une\nmodération humaine\ndes contenus posté.\nThis is how we strive to put our opinions aside and reflect on several in order to maintain a\nhuman moderation\ncontent posted.\nEn cas de dérapage, nous donnerons plus facilement un avertissement et une seconde chance, plutôt qu'un blocage de l'utilisateur qui interviendra en cas de récidive, ou de messages atteignant les limites du légal. Néanmoins, nous pouvons demander à effacer du contenu pour éventuellement le reposter avec une \"Confidentialité\" plus élevée si celui-ci est trop problématique.\nIn the event of a skid, we are more likely to give a warning and a second chance, rather than a blocking of the user who will intervene in case of recidivism, or messages reaching the limits of the right. Nevertheless, we are asking ourselves to delete content to possibly rely on it with a higher \"Confidentiality\" if it is too problematic.\nIl est aussi important de maintenir des relations chaleureuses entre l'équipe de modération et les utilisateurs, à la place de bloquer des messages et de utilisateurs à vue. N'hésitez donc pas à demander en cas de problème.\nIt is also important to maintain warm relationships between the moderation team and users, instead of blocking messages and users at sight. Do not hesitate to ask in case of problem.\nCependant, les contenus illégaux par rapport à la législation française peuvent-êtres supprimés plus rapidement. En effet, la législation impose à l'hébergeur d'un contenu illicite de le supprimer dès qu'il en a connaissance, sinon il sera vu comme responsable, au même titre que l'éditeur. Nous expliquerons tout de même les raisons de suppressions des messages aux utilisateurs inculpés.\nHowever, content that is illegal in relation to French legislation can be abolished more quickly. Indeed, the legislation imposes on the host of illicit content to remove it as soon as it knowingly, otherwise it will be seen as responsible, in the same way as the publisher. We will explain the reasons for the deletion of the messages to the accused users.\n\nL'équipe\nThe team\nListe des Modérateurs de l'instance :\nList of the instance's Moderators :\n\n@C_Chell\n\nMasquage et Blocage d'Instances\nMasking and Blocking of Instances\nLe \"fediverse\" contient des Instances qui n'ont pas les mêmes politiques de Modération que nous. Si EQS reçoit du contenu que nous prohibons venant d'une même instance, nous pouvons être amenés à la masquer du fil publique global.\nThe fediverse contains instances that do not have the same moderation policies as us. If EQS receives content that we prohibit from the same instance, we may have to mask it from the global public timeline.\nCependant, c'est un acte de dernier recourt : Nous pensons qu'il faut d'abord discuter avec les utilisateurs postant régulièrement du contenu prohibé sur EQS, comme par exemple de la pornographie sans masquer les images, puis les mettre sous silence si jamais cela les dérange.\nHowever, it is an act of last resort: We think it is necessary to first discuss with users regularly posting content prohibited on EQS, such as for example pornography without masking the images and then to silence them if ever It disturbs them.\nAucune instance ne sera bloquée par EQS pour son contenu, ses utilisateurs ou ses règles de modération.

A reincidência, após advertência, também ocasionará em suspensão.\n\nSpam (mensagens indesejadas ou não requisitadas).\nFlood (postar repetidamente ou pequenas mensagens sem intervalo) nas timelines públicas (local e global/federada).\nUtilizar as timelines públicas (local e global/federada) como sala de chat sem uso de citação ou reply.\nFancam flood.\n\nPolítica de aviso de conteúdo\nO Mastodon possui uma funcionalidade chamada de \"aviso de conteúdo\", em inglês “content warning” ou “CW”. Para mais informações sobre o uso, veja este post.\nO uso de aviso de conteúdo é\nobrigatorio\nem postagens que:\n\nMencionam assuntos traumáticos (por exemplo: abuso, estupro, violência).\nContenham enredo de séries, jogos e filmes (por exemplo: \"Spoilers de Power Rangers S01E01\").\nContenham nudez, conteúdo sexual e imagens de violência (mesmo que em representações artísticas).\nDescrições explícitas de sexo ou conteúdo sexual em\npostagens públicas\n.\nVídeos com movimentos rápidos e luzes intermitentes.\n\nO uso de aviso de conteúdo não é obrigatório, mas sugerido, em postagens envolvendo os seguintes assuntos ou imagens relacionadas:\n\nPolítica\nDistúrbios mentais\nDistúrbios alimentares\nRelacionamentos abusivos\nComida\nÁlcool, cigarro e outras drogas\nAranhas, répteis e outras coisas que podem causar desconforto em pessoas que possuem fobias\nRetratos de si, principalmente aquelas com contato ocular direto\n\nLembre-se, os posts são abertos, a não ser que se escolha postar apenas para seguidores, e nem todo mundo curte o que você curte. Tenha bom senso e use o aviso de conteúdo em assuntos que você gosta muito mas que pode incomodar outras pessoas, como esportes, programas de tv, etc.\nÉ simples, rápido e indolor.\nInatividade\nContas inativas por mais de um ano estão sujeitas a serem removidas da plataforma. Enviaremos um aviso alguns dias antes, dando a possibilidade que a pessoa possa manter a conta.\nSobre níveis de privacidade\nNo Mastodon cada status pode ser postado em quatro diferentes configurações de audiência. É importante ter isso em mente porque certas regras só se aplicam a determinadas configurações:\n\nPública:\nA publicação é enviada para as timelines local e global/federada, compartilhadas por outros membros da instância, é enviada para todos os seguidores, aparece na página pública de perfil da pessoa que postou, aparece em buscas por hashtags.\n\nNão listada:\nA publicação é enviada para todos os seguidores, aparece na página pública de perfil da pessoa que postou, não aparece em buscas por hashtags e não aparece em timelines local ou global/federada.\n\nPrivada:\nA publicação é enviada apenas para os seguidores.\n\nDireta:\nA publicação é enviada apenas para os usuários mencionados.\n\nSobre Crossposters\nCrossposters são ferramentas, automatizadas ou não, usadas para postar a partir de outras redes (como Twitter ou Tumblr) para o Mastodon. O uso destas ferramentas é permitido, mas as seguintes regras se aplicam:\n\nRetweet, quotes (retweets com comentários) ou reblogs não podem ser postados com privacidade pública.\nPosts vindos de outras redes, como o Twitter, ainda precisam obedecer à outras regras desse código, tais como avisos de conteúdo.\nCrossposters só podem ser usados na condição de que você acompanha as suas notificações, do contrário resultará em suspensão após uma advertência.\n\nComo reportar uma violação do código de conduta\nO Mastodon possui ferramentas internas de denúncia.

If this is not okay with\r\n    you, this might not be the instance for you.\nAlso, for truly private data sent between two people, Mastodon offers no E2E encryption.

We do not allow pictures of dead animals on our public timeline.\nBrands & Products\nWhile it is encouraged on the instance to share personal projects, it is discouraged to use the platform as a \"brand\", or to use your account to do repeated promotion of products. You're welcome to create an alt account on another instance and promote these toots, keep the local timeline free of advertisements.\nNSFW\nNSFW content is permitted, but only under certain conditions:\n\nPut your post under a Content Warning.\nInclude \"nsfw\" in the text of the Content Warning.\n\nPosts promoting certain types of problematic content are explicitly not allowed, including:\n\nBestiality (any sexualized depiction of non-cognizant animals)\n\nClarification\n: Explicit furry art, or sexual depictions of anthropomorphized animals who have the mental capacity to consent, is allowed. However, sexual depictions (and especially photography) of animals who cannot consent is not allowed at all. If capacity to consent is unclear, removal of a piece of content will be left to the administrators.\n\nPedophilia (or any sexualized depiction of children or young animals)\n\nBlocked Domains\nMerveilles.town restricts content from some domains.

Public posts are viewable by anyone outside of Mastodon. Please keep this in mind when planning direct actions or sensitive militant operations, and consider moving to an encrypted form of communication for this type of work.\nOur servers are under French jurisdiction.\nFrench laws do apply here\n.\nPorn and nudity are allowed, but must have a CW. Lolicon and sexual discussions or depictions of minors are never allowed.\nContent Warning must be used for the following topics:\nviolence in text or media\nbigotry, including but not limited to transphobia, sexism, racism, homophobia, sizeism, ableism, and classism in text or media\nphysical or mental health, including but not limited to eating disorders, suicide, illness or injuries\nsexual content in text or medias\n\nWhile we don't have specific rules about adding CW's to the following topics, they are appreciated by our members and our neighbors throughout the fediverse:\npolitics of any kind\nfood\nstorms and bad weather\nlinks or references to Twitter (aka \"birdsite\") or Facebook\nbody image or weight\n\nParody accounts are\nallowed\n, and must be identified as such in their description or name.\n\nReporting content / abuse\nYou can report a toot by using the built-in \"report\" button, which appears under every toot (\"three dots\" button).

This is not our full-time job— we do our best, but downtime sometimes happens.

A reincidência, após advertência, ocasionará em suspensão.\n\nFloodar as timelines públicas (local e federada) com o envio repetido e rápido de mensagens com a seleção de audiência PÚBLICO.\nSpam (mensagens ou propagandas indesejadas ou não requisitadas).\nEnvio de imagens de nudez autoral e/ou de nú artístico não sinalizadas com o alerta de conteúdo apropriado (NUDEZ) e não devidamente marcadas como sensíveis.\nAtaques à dignidade de outros camaradas tais como mensagens agressivas, ofensas pessoais (\nad hominem\n) e provocações reiteradas para desestabilizar uma conversa ou uma pessoa, práticas conhecidas como\nTrollagem\n(\nportuguês\n) e\nFlaming\n(\nportuguês\n). Queremos que este seja um ambiente de camaradagem, respeito e debates saudáveis.\n\nB. Política de alerta de conteúdo (content warning / CW)\nO Mastodon possui uma funcionalidade chamada de \"alerta de conteúdo\" (content warning - CW). Para mais informações sobre o uso, veja\neste post\n.\nB.1. Os seguintes alertas de conteúdo são\nobrigatórios\n(e imagens devem ser marcadas como sensíveis):\n\nVIOLÊNCIA\n: Assuntos traumáticos (como estupro, morte, suicídio etc.), bem como descrições ou imagens de violência (mesmo que em representações artísticas).\n\nNUDEZ\n: Imagens de nudez autoral/artística ou de conteúdo sexual, bem como descrições explícitas de sexo ou conteúdo sexual. (Lembrando que pornografia comercial não é admitida nesta instância.)\n\nLUZES INTERMITENTES\n: Vídeos com movimentos rápidos e luzes intermitentes.\n\nSPOILERS DE ________\n: Contenham enredo de séries, jogos ou filmes (por exemplo: 'SPOILERS DE Power Rangers S01E01').\n\nB.2. Os seguintes alertas de conteúdo não são obrigatórios, mas\nsugeridos\n, em postagens envolvendo os seguintes assuntos ou imagens relacionadas:\n\nCOMIDA\n: Imagens de alimentos.\n\nTÓXICOS\n: Álcool, cigarro e outras substâncias tóxicas.\n\nFOBIA\n: Aranhas, répteis e outras coisas que possam causar desconforto em pessoas que possuem fobias.\n\nSELFIE\n: Retratos de si, principalmente aquelas com contato ocular direto.\n\nC. Política sobre inatividade da conta\n\nContas inativas por mais de um ano estão sujeitas a serem removidas da plataforma. Enviaremos um aviso alguns dias antes, dando a possibilidade para que a pessoa possa manter a conta.\nContas que não tenham sido efetivamente utilizadas em até dez dias após a criação estão sujeitas a serem removidas da plataforma sem aviso prévio.\n\nD. Sobre níveis de audiência\nNo Mastodon cada status pode ser postado em quatro diferentes configurações de audiência. É importante ter isso em mente porque certas regras só se aplicam a algumas configurações e não a outras:\n\nPÚBLICA\n: A publicação aparece no feed dos seus seguidores, na página pública do seu perfil, na busca por hashtags, no feed local (compartilhado pelos demais membros da instância) e no feed federado (compartilhado por todas as instâncias federadas).\n\nNÃO LISTADA\n: A publicação aparece no feed dos seus seguidores e na página pública do seu perfil. Porém, não é listada (não aparece) em buscas por hashtags, nem no feed local, nem no feed federado.\n\nSOMENTE SEGUIDORES\n: A publicação aparece apenas no feed dos seus seguidores. Porém, não aparece na página pública do seu perfil, nem em buscas por hashtags, nem no feed local, nem no feed federado.\n\nMENSAGEM DIRETA\n: A publicação aparece apenas no feed das pessoas marcadas por você.\n\nATENÇÃO\n:\nMensagens diretas\nnão devem ser confundidas\ncom mensagens privadas\n, pois o Mastodon não é uma ferramenta projetada para a troca segura de mensagens criptografadas de ponta a ponta. Os moderadores da instância podem acessar todas as mensagens publicadas a qualquer momento e o farão em casos de denúncias. Leia a nossa\npolítica sobre mensagens diretas\nmais adiante.\nE. Política sobre crossposters\nCrossposters são ferramentas, automatizadas ou não, usadas para publicar no Mastodon a partir de outras redes (como Twitter ou Tumblr). O uso destas ferramentas é permitido, mas as seguintes regras se aplicam:\n\nRetweet, quotes (retweets com comentários) ou reblogs NÃO PODEM ser postados com perfil de audiência PÚBLICO. Devem ser programados para o perfil de audiência\nNÃO LISTADO\nou SOMENTE SEGUIDORES.\nPosts vindos de outras redes (como o Twitter) também precisam obedecer a todas as demais regras deste código, tais como aquelas relacionadas aos alertas de conteúdo.\nCrossposters só podem ser usados na condição de que você acompanhe as suas notificações pelo menos com alguma regularidade; do contrário, resultará em suspensão após uma advertência.\nA conta de origem do crosspost deve ser sua, e não de terceiros. Nesta instância não é permitida a criação de contas (bot) criadas exclusivamente para replicar conteúdos produzidos por terceiros. Existem serviços especializados em criar contas (bot) para fazer crossposting diretamente de contas e de feeds RSS de agências de notícias, como a instância\nNewsBots.eu\n, por exemplo.\n\nF. Como reportar uma violação do código de conduta\nO Mastodon possui ferramentas internas de denúncia. Qualquer post ou perfil que você acredite que esteja em violação dessas regras pode ser denunciado utilizando a ferramenta interna do Mastodon e ele será enviado aos moderadores.\nCaso a sua denúncia seja relativa a um dos moderadores, você pode reportar a violação por meio de mensagem direta a um dos outros moderadores, sem a necessidade de utilizar a ferramenta interna de denúncia.\nVocê pode fazer uma denúncia mesmo que a sua situação não seja diretamente coberta por essas regras, caso a situação lhe cause desconforto. A moderação irá avaliar cada caso concretamente.\nRespondemos de maneira privada a todas as denúncias que recebemos, fazendo um esforço para que a primeira resposta seja dada nas primeiras 24 horas.\nG. Política sobre mensagens diretas\nATENÇÃO: Mensagens diretas\nnão são\nmensagens privadas.\nO Mastodon não é uma ferramenta projetada para a troca segura de mensagens criptografadas de ponta a ponta. Tenha em mente que os moderadores podem acessar a qualquer momento todas as mensagens publicadas na instância, inclusive as mensagens com audiência reduzida (mensagens diretas), e o farão sempre que houver alguma denúncia. De fato, o acesso às mensagens trocadas entre usuários ocorre em todas as plataformas tais como Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Gmail etc.\nOs moderadores da URSAL.zone pactuam dois compromissos com a comunidade em relação às mensagens com audiência reduzida (mensagens diretas):\n\nOs moderadores da URSAL.zone\nacessarão\no conteúdo de mensagens diretas sempre que e exclusivamente nos casos em que algum dos usuários citados em uma mensagem direta denuncie a publicação ou seu autor.\nOs moderadores da URSAL.zone\nnão acessarão\no conteúdo de mensagens diretas em nenhum outro caso (até porque as pessoas têm mais o que fazer do que ficar xeretando as mensagens alheias), sob pena desta ação ser analisada pelos demais camaradas moderadores podendo ser punidos com suspensão ou até banimento por quebra de confiança.\n\nApesar deste compromisso, queremos que você\nnão utilize\no recurso de restrição da audiência (mensagens diretas) caso não se sinta confortável ou seguro para fazê-lo. Além disso, você\nnão deve\nutilizar o Mastodon para transmitir informações sensíveis ou sigilosas sob qualquer hipótese.\n(A bem da verdade, você\nnão deveria\ntransmitir informações sensíveis e sigilosas em nenhuma rede social ou em qualquer plataforma que não tenha sido projetada para esta finalidade.)\nCaso você tenha a necessidade de trocar mensagens com privacidade e segurança,\nrecomendamos\no uso de ferramentas e de protocolos não comerciais e não governamentais que implementem criptografia de ponta-a-ponta, tenham sido desenvolvidas com softwares livres em toda sua arquitetura (cliente e servidor) e sigam o estado da arte dos protocolos criptográficos públicos.\nAs\nsugestões\na seguir são facilmente acessíveis para qualquer usuário, porém, caso a sua necessidade de privacidade e de segurança na troca de mensagens seja muito elevada, você precisará de mais do que isso para se proteger de maneira efetiva.\n\nO mensageiro instantâneo\nSignal\n.\nO serviço de e-mail\nProtonmail\n.\n\n(\nNão utilize\nWhatsApp, Telegram, qualquer rede social como Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, ou qualquer serviço de e-mail como Gmail/Google ou Outlook/Microsoft para trocar mensagens confidenciais.)\nVocê pode entrar em contato com os moderadores da URSAL.zone caso precise de ajuda ou orientação.\nH. Compromisso em caso de encerramento das atividades da comunidade\nA URSAL.zone está alinhada à boa prática pactuada internacionalmente entre as instâncias federadas e, caso no futuro, por algum motivo de força maior, surja a necessidade de encerrarmos as atividades da instância, nos comprometemos a comunicar a comunidade com no mínimo três meses de antecedência.\nMas a URSAL veio para ficar, camaradas! =)\nI.

Federação e instâncias com as quais temos restrições\nPor ser um software descentralizado e federado, os servidores do Mastodon (chamados de \"instâncias\"), podem se comunicar com algumas ou muitas instâncias e não se comunicar com outras. (Saiba mais na Wikipedia:\nDistributed social network\n,\nActivityPub\n(\nportuguês\n),\nFediverse\nand\nMastodon\n(\nportuguês\n).)\nA instância URSAL.zone se conecta (se federa) com a ampla maioria das milhares de instâncias Mastodon, com\nexceção\ndaquelas cujos códigos de conduta sejam incompatíveis com o nosso e/ou cujos moderadores reiteradamente não tomem providências em relação a denúncias de violação das regras pactuadas em seus códigos de conduta. Estas exceções podem ser vistas na nossa lista de bloqueios e silenciamentos disponível adiante na seção \"Unavailable content\" (conteúdo indisponível).\nI.3.

Dicas\nUse o\nMastodon Twitter Crossposter\npara fazer com que o conteúdo postado no Mastodon seja enviado para o Twitter ou vice-versa. Lembre-se de seguir a nossa\npolítica sobre crossposters\ne de\nconfigurar a audiência para\nNÃO LISTADO\nou para PRIVADO. Não deixe configurado como PÚBLICO os retweets nem os quotes (retweets com comentários) sob risco de ter a conta suspensa.\n~~~ // ~~~\nEnglish Version of URSAL.zone's Code of Conduct\nURSAL.zone is a\nMastodon instance\ngeared towards people from Latin America who identify themselves as progressives, antifascists and against to all and any forms of oppression, exploitation and humiliation between human beings. We are also a community that is feminist, antiracist, anticolonialist, accessible and inclusive to trans and non-binary people.\nThis instance is\nmoderated\nand the\nminimum age\nto participate is 18 years old.\nTo keep this space this way, all users from URSAL.zone need to follow our code of conduct described below.

Content Warning policy\nMastodon has a feature called \"Content Warning\" (CW). For more information about it's usage check\nthis post\n.\nB.1. Content Warning is\nrequired\nin toots that:\n\nVIOLENCE\n: Traumatic subjects (such as rape, death, suicide), as well as descriptions or images of violence (even if in artistic representations).\n\nNUDE\n: Images of authorial/artistic nudity or sexual content, as well as explicit descriptions of sex or sexual content.

We'll send a warning a few days before, allowing the user to keep the account.\nAccounts that have not been used effectively within ten days of creation are subject to being removed from the platform without notice.\n\nD. About audience levels\nIn Mastodon each status can be posted with one of four different audience configurations. It's important to have that in mind because certain rules apply only to one or other configuration:\n\nPUBLIC\n: The toot is sent to the \"local\" and \"federated\" timelines (which are shared by other members of the instance), is sent to all followers, appears in the public profile page of the person that posted it and appears in hashtag searches.\n\nUNLISTED\n: The toot is sent to all followers, appears in the public profile page of the person that posted it, but does not appear in hashtag searches.\n\nFOLLOWERS-ONLY\n: The toot is sent to all followers, but does not appear in the public profile page of the person that posted it, nor does it appear in hashtag searches.\n\nDIRECT MESSAGE\n: The post appears only in the tagged people's feed.\n\nATTENTION\n:\ndirect messages\nmust not be\nconfused with private messages\n, as Mastodon is not a tool designed for the secure exchange of encrypted messages from end to end. Instance moderators can access all posted messages at any time and will do so in case of complaints. Read our\ndirect messaging policy\nbelow.\nE. Policy on crossposters\nCrossposters are tools, automated or otherwise, used to post from other networks (such as Twitter or Tumblr) into Mastodon. The use of such tools is allowed, but the following rules apply:\n\nRetweet, quotes (retweets with comments) or reblogs CANNOT be posted with the PUBLIC audience setting. They must be programmed for the\nUNLISTED\nor FOLLOWERS-ONLY audience setting only.\nPosts from other networks (such as Twitter) must also obey all other rules in this code, such as those related to content alerts.\nCrossposters can only be used on the condition that you follow your notifications at least with some regularity; otherwise, it will result in suspension after a warning.\nThe crosspost source account must be yours, not a third party's. In this instance it is not allowed to create accounts (bot) created exclusively to replicate content produced by third parties. There are services specialized in creating accounts (bot) to crosspost directly from accounts and RSS feeds from news agencies, such as the\nNewsBots.eu\ninstance, for example.\n\nF. How to report a code of conduct violation\nMastodon has tools for reporting toots and profiles. Any toot or profile you believe that's violating a rule of this code can be reported using the reporting tools and it will be sent to all moderators.\nIf your report is relative to one of the moderators, you can report the violation through direct message to one of the other moderators.\nYou can report a toot or profile even if the situation is not described directly in these rules, if the situation cause you discomfort. The moderation team will evaluate each case individually.\nWe will respond in a private manner to all reports we receive, making an effort that the first response is given in the first 24 hours.\nG. Direct messaging policy\nATTENTION: Direct messages\nare not\nprivate messages.\nMastodon is not a tool designed for the secure exchange of encrypted messages from end to end. Keep in mind that moderators can access all messages posted on the instance at any time, including messages with reduced audience (direct messages), and will do so whenever there is a complaint. In fact, access to messages exchanged between users occurs on all platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Gmail etc.\nThe moderators of URSAL.zone agree two commitments with the community regarding messages with reduced audience (direct messages):\n\nThe moderators of URSAL.zone\nwill access\nthe content of direct messages whenever and exclusively in cases where any of the users mentioned in a direct message denounces the publication or its author.\nThe moderators of URSAL.zone\nwill not access\nthe content of direct messages in any other case (not least because people have more to do than inspecting other people's messages), under penalty of this action being analyzed by the other moderating comrades and may be punished with suspension or even banning for breach of trust.\n\nDespite this commitment, we want you\nnot to use\nthe audience restriction feature (direct messages) if you are not comfortable or safe to do so. In addition, you should not use Mastodon to transmit sensitive or confidential information under any circumstances.\n(Indeed, you\nshould not\ntransmit sensitive and sensitive information on any social network or on any platform that is not designed for this purpose.)\nIf you need to exchange messages with privacy and security, we\nrecommend\nthe use of non-commercial and non-governmental tools and protocolos that implement end-to-end encryption, have been developed with free software across its architecture (client and server) and follow the state of the art of public cryptographic protocols.\nThe following\nsuggestions\nare easily accessible to any user, however, if your need for privacy and security when exchanging messages is very high, you will need more than that to protect yourself effectively.\n\nThe\nSignal\ninstant messenger.\nThe\nProtonmail\nemail service.\n\n(\nDo not use\nWhatsApp, Telegram, any social network like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, or any email service like Gmail/Google or Outlook/Microsoft to exchange confidential messages.)\nYou can contact the URSAL.zone moderators if you need help or guidance.\nH. Commitment in the event of the closure of community activities\nURSAL.zone is in line with the internationally agreed good practice among the federated instances and, if in the future, for some reason of force majeure, the need to end the activities of the body arises, we commit to communicating to the community with at least three months of advance.\nBut URSAL is here to stay, comrades! =)\nI. About the URSAL.zone instance\nI.1. Our moderation team\nOur current moderation team is composed by\n@DanielaAbade\n,\n@oiceberg\n,\n@arioldo\ne\n@mohammed_alkhwarizmi\n.\nI.2. Federation and instances with which we have restrictions\nBecause it is a decentralized and federated software, Mastodon servers (known as \"instances\"), can communicate with other instances and not communicate with others. (Learn more at Wikipedia:\nDistributed social network\n,\nActivityPub\n,\nFediverse\nand\nMastodon\n.)\nThe URSAL.zone instance connects (federates) with the vast majority of the thousands of Mastodon instances, with the exception of those whose codes of conduct are incompatible with ours and/or whose moderators have repeatedly failed to take action regarding allegations of violation of the rules agreed in their codes of conduct. These exceptions can be seen in our list of blocks and silences available below in the section \"Unavailable content\".\nI.3. Artistic attribution\nMost of our emojis are the work of\n@DanielaAbade\n; others were created by\n@abacaxi\n.\nWe use some emoji from the\nMutant Standard Emoji\nwhich are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n).\nThe art in the main page and link previews was drawn by\n@DanielaAbade\n.\nI.4. Useful information\nFollow\n@Ursalzona\nand see the pinned toots for guides, news and important information about the instance such as updates and planned downtime.\nI.5. Tips\nUse the\nMastodon Twitter Crossposter\nto get the content posted on the Mastodon to Twitter or vice versa. Remember to follow our\npolicy on crossposters\nand\nset your audience to UNLISTED\nor PRIVATE. Do not leave retweets or quotes configured as PUBLIC at risk of having your account suspended.\n~~~ // ~~~\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

The rules pretty much boil down to \"be good to each other\", but a few rules I'd like to explicitly list out are as follows:\n\nAny content or postings which may be illegal under German or Scottish law are not permitted.\nAny content or postings containing Nazi symbolism, ideology and the promotion thereof, are strictly forbidden and seriously uncool.\nRacism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia and any other discriminatory conduct which attacks any individual or group of individuals based on what they are or what they believe in, is strictly forbidden and also seriously uncool.\nAny conduct which abuses this Mastodon instance, or which causes harm to other Mastodon instances, and/or the users thereof, is strictly forbidden and seriously uncool.\nWhile essentially all posts not violating the above are welcome on this instance, you are asked to be considerate and respectful of others - for example, tagging a post about a controversial subject or a commonly-held phobia using content warnings.\nBasic parts of your user profile, such as username/display name, profile picture and banner,\nmust not\nbe explicit in nature.\nExplicit/NSFW content is allowed, but\nmust\nbe appropriately tagged using the sensitive media and content warning tags.\n\nTips are appreciated!\nYou can throw spare change my way by visiting my\ntip-jar!\nRegistrations are now available without approval thanks to to the introduction of our CAPTCHA system.\n\nThis is not Twitter\n. Reporting posts that make you feel uncomfortable, or that you feel should be brought to our attention, is highly encouraged. Your reports\nwill not be ignored\n, and will be dealt with (usually) within a few days. Due to timezone differences or just the fact that I have a full-time job, it may take more than a week, but you will\nalways\nhear back about your report, and it won't be closed until you're happy with the resolution for the report. If your report involves a user or post on another instance, you have the choice of sharing your report with the administration of that instance as well, but the report will always be sent to us. Please include in the report whether you chose to send the report to the other instance, though.\nNo moderation actions are automatic\nwhatsoever\n. Nothing happens without human review, and I try to do my utmost to do right by the users on this instance.\nFor anything that isn't covered by reporting things in Mastodon, or if you have any questions, concerns or other thoughts, please either direct-message @Maffsie@queer.party, or email the queries address posted above - this goes directly to my inbox.\nA status page for this Mastodon instance is available\nhere\n, with a secondary (older) status page\nhere\n.\nThis instance uses\nMutant Standard emoji\nmade by\nDzuk\n, which are licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License\n.\n\nTransparency is important\n. Where administrative decisions have been made that impacts the userbase of queer.party, those decisions will be detailed on this page.\r\nThis currently takes the form of two tables detailing domains blocked from federation, and from user registrations. No other administrative decisions or actions have been made at present.\nOur federation policy is open-first, however in cases where an instance has been identified as either being indifferent to, permissive of, or as actively encouraging abusive conduct to this or other instances, that instance's domain will be blocked from federation. The block is typically a suspension, such that no interaction between queer.party and the offending instance can take place, however in cases where there is a lesser risk (eg., an instance that is indifferent to abusive conduct but is not known for being a source of abusive conduct), the block is typically a silence block, such that individual users can still interact with each other, but they must be following each other, and posts do not appear in the federated timeline.\nExceptions to the above are rare, but do happen. Currently, a blanket federation ban is in place for all Gab Social and Soapbox instances, for what should be obvious reasons. Where a specific instance has been blocked, it will be listed\non the Unavailable Content list\n.\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse. These are the exceptions that have been made on this particular server.\nFiltered media\nMedia files from these servers will not be processed or stored, and no thumbnails will be displayed, requiring manual click-through to the original file:\n\n\nServer\nReason\n\n\n\nbaraag.net\n\n\n\ngs.kawa-kun.com\n\n\n\npawoo.net\n\n\n\nrubber.social\n\n\n\nsinblr.com\n\n\n\nanime.website\n\nInstance federation policy is questionable, and ToS document specifically directs users to a \"curated list\" of instances which they recommend, all of the listed instances are freezepeach havens which have long been blocked on queer.party.

Bots should avoid posting to the public timeline.\nNo pornography.\nNo gore or graphic violence.\nContent that is borderline NSFW or could be construed as NSFW at a glance should be put behind a CW (Content Warning).\nNo racism.\nNo sexism.\nNo discrimination based on gender, sexual minority, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or national origin.\nNo xenophobia, nationalism, casteism, or fascism; no sympathizing with or advocating for these things.\nNo sexual depictions of children.\nNo holocaust denialism, no Nazi symbolism, no promotion of National Socialism.\nNo stalking or harassment. In general, if someone asks you to stop interacting with them, then stop.\nNo posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\nNo unwelcome sexual attention.\nNo public or private oppressive language or actions.\nNo promotion of conspiracy theories (eg anti-vax, anti-mask, anti-COVID).\nNo unsolicited advice to strangers.\nNo advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.\nNo other unethical conduct.\nNo scraping content from web interface or API.\n\nTo\nprotect the free speech of users belonging to marginalized groups\n, mastodon.technology does not federate with overtly fascist instances. Additionally, we will refuse to federate with instances that themselves choose to federate with fascist instances.\nOur\nlist of blocked instances\nis publicly documented.\nHandling harassment\nIf you are being harassed, please report the user using the \"…\" button and then \"Report.\" For urgent concerns, please DM\nAsh\n.\nIf you engage in harassing behavior, the moderator may take any action they deem appropriate, such as a warning or an expulsion.\nThe above rules may change at any time, and you may be banned at any time based on the moderators' judgment.\nPrivacy policy\nWhat will we do with your data? Nothing. How will you be influenced by advertisers? You won't. How will we aggregate your data in order to improve your service… none of that.\nWe will never share your data with anyone else, except in the case of valid legal requests if it comes to that. (Hopefully it won't come to that!) Similarly, users and third parties are forbidden from scraping content from the instance's web interface or API; you are required to respect\nrobots.txt\nfiles.\nMore privacy measures on mastodon.technology:\n\nHTTPS is used everywhere thanks to Let's Encrypt.\nNo ads or trackers.\nLinks are direct URLs rather than tracking redirects.\nUnderstand though that this instance is run by Ash, and (as is the case with all Mastodon servers) he potentially have access to your data, including DMs. The back-end is also not encrypted. If this is not okay with you, this might not be the instance for you.\n\nAlso, for truly private data sent between two people, Mastodon offers no E2E encryption. So use Signal for the things you really want to be private.\nUnavailable content\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

We'll send a warning a few days before, allowing the user to keep the account.\nOn privacy levels\nIn Mastodon each status can be posted with one of three different audience configurations. It's important to have that in mind because certain rules apply only to one or other configuration:\n\nFollowers-only: The toot is sent to all followers, but does not appear in the public profile page of the person that posted it, nor does it appear in hashtag searches.\nUnlisted: The toot is sent to all followers, appear in the public profile page of the person that posted it, but does not appear in hashtag searches.\nPublic: The toot is sent to the \"local\" and \"federated\" timelines (which are shared by other members of the instance), is sent to all followers, appears in the public profile page of the person that posted it and appears in hashtag searches.\n\nOn Crossposters\nCrossposters are tools, automated or otherwise, used to post from other networks (such as Twitter or Tumblr) into Mastodon. The use of such tools is allowed, but the following rules apply:\n\nRetweets, quotes (retweets with comments) or reblogs\ncannot\nbe posted with the \"Public\" privacy setting.\nPosts coming from other networks, such as Twitter, still need to obey to the other rules described in this code of conduct, such as the content warning policy.\nCrossposters can only be used with the condition that you follow your notifications, otherwise they will result in suspension after a first warning.\n\nHow to report a code of conduct violation\nMastodon has tools for reporting toots and profiles. Any toot or profile you believe that's violating a rule of this code can be reported using the reporting tools and it will be sent to all moderators.\nIf your report is relative to one of the moderators, you can report the violation through direct message to one of the other moderators.\nYou can report a toot or profile even if the situation is not described directly in these rules, if the situation cause you discomfort. The moderation team will evaluate each case individually.\nWe will respond in a private manner to all reports we receive, making an effort that the first response is given in the first 24 hours.\nAbout Mastodonte\nOur moderation team\nOur current moderation team is composed by\n@\nrenatolond\n,\n@\nabacaxi\n,\n@\nanna\n,\n@\namber\ne\n@\nohtori\nmasto.donte.com.br particularities\nmasto.donte.com.br uses a slightly modified version of Mastodon, with the following changes:\n\nUp to 500 characters in the bio (instead of the normal 160)\nPossibility to publish instance-only toots (toots that do not federate to other instances)\n\nArtistic attribution\nA lot of our emojis are the work of\n@\nabacaxi\n, among others:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heart with the pride flags were made by Cam, CAMERATA#4771 in discord:\n\n\n\n\nThe pride marbles were made by\nUnascribed\n:\n\n\n\n\nThe chimarrão emoji was made by\n@\nAster\n:\n.\nWe use some emoji from the\nMutant Standard emoji\nwhich are licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License\n.\nThe art in the main page and link previews was drawn by\nMamá Galsi\n.\nUseful information\nFollow\n@status\nfor updates, planned downtimes and similar info.\nFollow\n@ambassador\nfor the a manually curated view of our most popular toots.\n\nConteúdo indisponível\nMastodon geralmente permite que você veja o conteúdo e interaja com usuários de qualquer outra instância no fediverso.

        "aboutMore": "\nnotbird.site is a left wing progressive and welcoming space. to keep it a space open to all where they can feel safe, we have the following guidelines for our users and moderators:\n-Discrimination against those lower down on the social ladder this includes, but it not limited to: racism, homophobia, antisemitism, transphobia, classism against the working class, ableism, gate keeping of identities and general exclusionary behavior, misogyny, genocide denial, harassment, Islamophobia. We support and recognise other-kin as well as plural systems, we will not accept any questioning of their legitimacy as identities. We do endorse punching up because reverse racism and things like that aren't real\n-All illegal content is not allowed on notbird.site whatsoever, regardless of the legitimacy of the law. Illegal content will get the server taken down, and a one person crusade is not worth that hassle. We do not endorse any illegal actions what so ever on notbird.site\n-notbird.site is an anti fascist space. We endorse and support the idea of deplatforming and fighting fascism at every turn, as such we consistently de-federate with fascistic instances, and do not care who is on those instances. Because of this anti fascist stance, any and all users on notbird or other instances will be immediately cut off from our community if there is even any suspicion of fascistic tendencies. explicit fascist dog whistles such as the '((( )))' antisemitic echo and symbols like the frog emoji will be looked at in context, many people may be using things in a non fascist context or not understand the meaning behind something and we are always looking to understand and educate in the fight against fascism\n-notbird.site is not an advertising platform. While fund raising and users selling their own products or sex workers advertising to get by is more than acceptable, notbird.site is not a platform for capitalists to advertise on and park their social media brand accounts on; in the same vein we refuse to allow the platforming of any government agencies or law enforcement on our instance\n-As we try to be an accepting space, we ask you do the following to be inclusive in your posting. Use the content warning system to allow for those who may find topics triggering, obvious examples include: food, sexual content, assault, mental health issues, and any other topics at your own discretion; explicitly sexual content should always be marked as such, be it text or images. second of all, we ask that people please use the image description system for all images posted, yes even large blocks of text, it's very easy for those who are able bodied to transcribe the text and descriptions of visual situations\n-Consistent spam is not allowed, even when considered to be a joke by the user. while a repetition of a line here or there may be just a joke, spamming where much of the local timeline is taken up by a single user posting the same or similar variations of a word or phrase fast and continuously will be removed\n-Bad faith rules lawyering in an attempt to avoid the clear and obvious progressive intent of these rules is unacceptable behavior, even when done for the sake of 'playing devil's advocate'. if you have issues with the lettering of a point here, please discuss it with the rest of the community and an open and honest criticism\n-All rules on notbird are made by the community, for the community. We are a community who built a space we want to be in, and as such all rules are subject to change by the participation of community members in talking about changing old rules or adding new ones. We welcome new ideas, new perspectives, and a discussion about what makes a space as open and positive as possible. No conversation is final, and old topics are always welcome to be brought back to the table for discussion by the community by any user who requests it\nA general failure to follow these guidelines will lead to the removal of your posts, and eventually your account should we decide that the matter is serious enough\nThese rules are copied (with permission) from hellsite.site\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

We prefer •ART to be your main home on the Fediverse not just for your art, but also for your daily thoughts, witty banter, and friendly communication. Our community of 9000+ artists are here to welcome you to your ad-free and open source decentralized creative home in the Fediverse.\nPlease read •ART's\netiquette\nand\nterms of use\nbefore signing up\n.\nClick here\nfor a list of suggested Mastodon mobile apps. We strive to make •ART a safe and supportive community for everyone — hate and bigotry have no place here. •ART has no ads or algorithms to mess with chronological timelines, and doesn't track you or profit off your data. Brands wishing to make an account here must be respectful by engaging with the local community. Accounts made solely to advertise will be suspended.\n•ART is run by members of the community and is not a company trying to profit off of your life and art with ads. As such, your support via\nLiberaPay\nor\nPatreon\nto help pay for hosting and operating costs is greatly appreciated.\n\nNote about registration requests:\nThis instance requires the \"Why do you want to join?\" field to be filled when requesting registration.\nBlank submissions will be rejected.\n\nMastodon.ART General Information\nMastodon.ART (•ART) is an independent community-run instance and is not affiliated with the\njoinMastodon.org\n(tootsuite) organization. The following guidelines are not a legal document, and final interpretation is up to the administrators and moderators of •ART. They are listed here to provide you with an insight into the site and our moderation policies.\nContents\n\nModeration Team\nGeneral Notice\nCode of Conduct\nCopyright\nFederation Policy\nHosting Information\n\n\nModeration Team\n\n@\nCurator\n(Instance Admin)\n@\nEmergencyBattle\n\n@\nScribbleAddict\n\n@\nTapiocaPearl\n\n@\nOtherbuttons\n\n@\nkatwylder\n\n\nGeneral Notice\n\nPlease consider making •ART your main home on the Fediverse and refrain from making art-only alt accounts here.\nRemember, federation allows your art to spread no matter which instance you join! We want art to flourish all over the Fediverse, not just within •ART. That being said, we are happy to have you if you want to make •ART your home on the Fediverse!\nFor more creative instances to join, check out\nthis list.\n\n\nThe following is not allowed on •ART: Bots, username squatting, registrations of famous trademarks/names (unless proof of identity is given).\nTo be certain that your account isn't removed due to inactivity, be sure to upload an avatar and post at least once. Accounts without avatars or any activity may be deleted to free up registration space on the instance.\n\nDo not use •ART as a permanent back up or repository for your information, statuses, or media.\nPlease keep an original copy of your work on your local machine, as Mastodon downsizes large file sizes. We cannot guarantee perpetual storage of your toots, information, or media on our servers. Please make a periodic local backup of your account to safeguard against possible data loss.\n\nYou may move your account to another instance at any time by using the \"Move to a different account\" setting at the bottom of your Edit Profile page in your Preferences.\nYou can also export your follow and block lists from the Import & Export page and import them into your new account to make the transition easier.\n\nYou may delete your account at any time using the \"Delete account\" option at the bottom of the Edit Profile page.\nKeep in mind that federation of your statuses to other servers or search engines is beyond •ART's control — statuses, media and federated copies of your profile may remain elsewhere. Deleting your account is permanent, cannot be undone, and your username/content cannot be reinstated.\n\nWe block or suspend many instances that do not adhere to •ART's ToS and CoC.\nAlso, instances are intermittently and temporarily silenced during report investigations or when other instance moderators are not monitoring their users for any of the behaviours against our ToS/CoC.\n\nPlease support the community\nby regularly boosting and positively interacting with other members.\n\nMastodon.ART has a\nLiberaPay Account\nand a\nPatreon\nif you'd like to support the operation and maintenance of our artistic community.\nThank you for enjoying and positively engaging with our friendly creative community!\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nThe following guidelines are not a legal document, and final interpretation is up to the administration of Mastodon.ART. These guidelines are here to provide you with an insight into the site and moderation policies because all members are guests here:\n\nAll users, local and remote, are expected to adhere to the following principles:\nIf you repost others' work, you must credit the original artist/author, and must include some form of analysis or opinion on the work posted. Pure reposting of other people's work is not permitted.\nPosting the same or similar content on multiple different instances (Fediverse servers) in order to spam local and/or federated timelines is not permitted.\nRespect other users' boundaries. Be respectful and sincerely apologize if someone informs you that a boundary has been crossed. Give people space if you accidentally push past a boundary.\nIf you find yourself involved in a conflict and are worried about the situation escalating, contact your moderation team.\nTag sensitive content such as violence/blood, NSFW content, and other potentially upsetting or triggering topics and hide them under a Content Warning (CW). CW is a big part of the culture of the Fediverse, and CW potentially upsetting content is how we keep our community and the wider Fediverse safe and supportive for everyone. (We also recommend people CW political posts, but we will not mandate it.)\n\nAll users, local and remote, will be considered in the wrong in a conversation that goes sour if they participate in the following:\nMicroaggressions (\"not all men\", white/man/cis-splaining, using the wrong pronouns to address someone after being corrected, ableism, etc.)\nDemanding education on problematic behaviour from a non-admin/moderator\nSkirting the lines of being a troll, or directly trolling\nSharing DM screenshots or quotes from DMs or private communications publicly without all parties' permission\nCreating memes about someone without their permission\nRanting or engaging in long rambling tangents on public timelines about a particular user without explicitly naming them (also known as \"subtooting\")\nNot tagging potentially sensitive or triggering toots\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and all moderation decisions are ultimately left up to the discretion of our mod team.  If any of these don't make sense, please speak with an admin or moderator. We are more than happy to help you understand the problems with these kinds of behaviours.\nThe following types of content will be removed from the public timeline:\nAdvertising and spam\nUnapproved news bots, post bots or follow bots\nUntagged/non-content-warned NSFW content\nPornographic or sexually explicit imagery that isn't tagged/content-warned and marked as Unlisted or Followers Only\nUntagged/non-content-warned gore and extremely graphic violence\n\nThe following types of content will be removed from the public timeline, and may result in account suspension and revocation of access to the service:\nRacism or advocation of racism\nSexism or advocation of sexism\nDiscrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or advocation thereof\nAbleism or discrimination against those who are neurodivergent, physically disabled, or mentally ill\nXenophobia and/or violent nationalism, or advocation thereof\n\nThe following types of content are explicitly disallowed and will result in revocation of access to the service:\nSexual depictions of minors, real or fictional\nContent illegal in Germany and/or France, such as holocaust denial or Nazi symbolism\nConduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism\n\n•ART has a zero-tolerance mandate for harassment or bullying — your account will be immediately suspended.\nAny conduct intended to stalk or harass other users, impede other users from using the service, degrade the performance of the service, or incite others to perform any of the aforementioned actions, is also disallowed and subject to punishment up to and including revocation of access to the service. This includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:\nContinuing to engage in conversation with a user that has specifically requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist may be considered harassment, regardless of platform-specific privacy tools employed.\nAggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person's demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called \"doxing\") will be considered harassment.\nInciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist (informally called \"brigading\" or \"dogpiling\") may be considered harassment.\n\nPlease do not flood the local timeline. We define \"flooding\" as posting three or more times per five minutes to the local/public timeline (but the definition is flexible; judgements on what is \"flooding\" or not will be made in context). Flooding drowns out other users and annoys instances we federate with.\nYou can reply to the toots of others and banter back and forth as much as you want, as replies aren't shown on the local/public timelines.\nPlease avoid posting many pieces of art/media all at once. Sticking to one post per ten minutes (with one-four pictures attached) is a good baseline to follow. Please respect others' content and statuses so that they can discover other artists in the local timeline.\nIf you'd like to post long threads of many toots, consider marking the first toot as \"public\", and the rest in replies marked as \"unlisted\". This will allow users to click through the first toot to read the rest of the thread without flooding the local/public timelines.\n\n\nRegarding nudity/NSFW content:\n\nIllustrative nudity, body/anatomy studies, and titillating imagery intended for mature audiences (eg. \"pin-ups\") are allowed on •ART, but\nonly\nif tagged appropriately (ex. #NSFW, #nudity, #lewd, etc.) and marked as sensitive or placed under a descriptive content warning.\nTags are required so people have the opportunity to filter such content from their timelines altogether.\nDescriptive text is required so that people can make an informed decision about whether to engage with the content below the cut/image blur or not.\nIf you're unsure whether to mark a work as sensitive or post it under a Content Warning, consider the following hypothetical questions: Is it something you'd be comfortable viewing in a white collar work situation? Is it something you'd be comfortable being viewed by a minor? Would you happily show it to your parents? A no to any of these questions may require it being CWed/marked as sensitive. If you're still unsure, marking it as sensitive/CWing it is a good bet.\nAnother way to decide whether to mark a work as sensitive or post it under a Content Warning is to remember the\nThree B's\n: If your work features any\nB\noobs,\nB\nutts, or\nB\nits (genitals), hide that sucker!\n\nIllustrative pornography and depictions of explicit sex acts or sexual nudity (e.g. erect or engorged genitalia, body fluids, manual manipulation of genitalia, sex toys in use, highly detailed depictions of genitalia, etc.)\nmust\nbe posted as \"Unlisted\" or \"Followers Only\" with appropriate tags/CWs. (You can change the visibility of your posts by pressing the globe icon under the toot compose box.)\nLoli or sexual content of questionable age is expressly prohibited — your account will be suspended. (This includes cub porn.)\nNude photographs are only allowed if done in an artistic spirit — however, it still needs to be tagged and CWed/marked as sensitive. Erotic photography, pornography, or photography that puts too much emphasis on the genitals is\nnot allowed\n, even if marked \"Unlisted\"/\"Followers Only\".\nWe understand that these things are subjective, but final interpretation of these rules are up to our moderation team. If in doubt, consider whether •ART is the right place for this kind of sexual/explicit work.\n\nGore, vore, and blood violence must also be placed under a descriptive content warning or marked sensitive.\n•ART's administration team reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, as well as to remove your data at any time due to inactivity of any duration (to help against future unmonitored accounts from being hacked and becoming spam bots), unethical use, or usage against •ART’s CoC/ToS. This includes repeatedly skirting the lines of rules in bad faith without explicitly crossing them, or without attempting to understand and respect the spirit in which these rules were written.\n\n\nCopyright\nAll original content is copyrighted by the artist and cannot be distributed or used without prior permission by the artist.\nDo not\nrepost or disseminate our artist's original content anywhere without their express permission.\nMastodon.art cares about your privacy and doesn't monetize or profit off of your personal information or art — your information is never for sale.\n\nFederation Policy\n\nFederating with Mastodon.ART is not guaranteed. Links between federated instances are temporary and may change or disappear at any time.\nOther instances may not disseminate our users' original content or toots without credit and proper licensing.\nOther instances may not use automated means to analyze any derived work for publication or profit without •ART's users' consent. This includes serving ads next to copyrighted content originally submitted on •ART.\nPublic toots are derived works that are protected by copyright.\nThis instance honours noindex/nofollow and search engines are not allowed to index content from such users.\nCrawling the content of the instance and creating a database of its posts and content for the purposes of archiving, searching, or analyzing is prohibited. We value our users' privacy and their ability to control how their data is utilized.\nWe will block, suspend, or silence any instance which permits any of the content or behaviour prohibited by this instance.\n\n\nHosting Information\n•ART is fully hosted and managed by\nMasto.host\n.\n\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse. These are the exceptions that have been made on this particular server.\nFiltered media\nMedia files from these servers will not be processed or stored, and no thumbnails will be displayed, requiring manual click-through to the original file:\n\n\nServer\nReason\n\n\n\nmstdn.jp\n\n\n\nanitwitter.moe\n\n\n\nbookwor.ms\n\n\n\nfeminism.lgbt\n\n\n\nfriends.nico\n\n\n\ninnerwebs.social\n\n\n\nkinky.business\n\n\n\nkpop.social\n\n\n\nlibertarianism.club\n\n\n\nnow.kibousoft.co.jp\n\n\n\nporntoot.com\n\n\n\nquitter.im\n\n\n\nswitter.at\n\n\n\n2.distsn.org\n\n\n\nassortedflotsam.com\n\n\n\nb.9chan.lol\n\n\n\ncreativity.cafe\n\n\n\ngs.kawa-kun.com\n\n\n\nloli.estate\n\n\n\nmastodon.network\n\n\n\nmicca.xyz\n\nTrolling, harassment\n\n\nmstdn.foxfam.club\n\nAlt-right, islamaphobia, xenophobia\n\n\npleroma.rareome.ga\n\n\n\npl.smuglo.li\n\n\n\npm.ernix.jp\n\n\n\npreteengirls.biz\n\n\n\nsocial.heckin.tech\n\n\n\nsocial.louisoft01.moe\n\n\n\nsocial.lucci.xyz\n\n\n\nsocial.mordicux.xyz\n\n\n\nsocial.oalm.gub.uy\n\n\n\nsocial.targaryen.house\n\n\n\nsocial.undernet.uy\n\n\n\ntoot.world\n\n\n\ntri.cash\n\n\n\nwitches.town\n\n\n\nwxw.moe\n\n\n\nxn--6r8h.tk\n\n\n\nSilenced servers\nPosts from these servers will be hidden in public timelines and conversations, and no notifications will be generated from their users interactions, unless you are following them:\n\n\nServer\nReason\n\n\n\n101010.pl\n\n\n\nartalley.social\n\nSilenced for accusations of hosting/defending underage sexual art.

Given our server is located outside of Japan we took a pro-active stance on blocking media as a \"just in case\" moment. This does\nnot\nmean you cannot interact with these instances, simply their media will not be cached or shown on our instance.\nSome instances we have chosen to remove from our federated timeline. You can still follow accounts on these instances and if you follow a user on one of the instances that does not appear on our federated timeline, their posts will show in your\npersonal\ntimeline. These are mainly instances that tend to be busy and/or are known for overloading our federated timeline with posts.\nSome instances we have chosen to block outright. Most of these instances are full of illegal content, hate speech and more. We've also blocked instances that have run harassment campaigns against others in the past. You will\nNOT\nbe able to interact with these instances from our instance.\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

This is a Mastodon instance that is focused around fostering a friendly and welcoming community for plural systems and plural-friendly singlets alike. Multiple accounts for each systemmate is also allowed, if you choose!\nFor our Privacy Policy and server information, see our\nTerms of Service\npage. We're also listed on Plural Hub! Follow\nthis link\nto see more plural communities and resources.\n\nThe instance's header artwork is made by\n@Mous\n.\n\nThe Plural Café administrators can be reached via email at admin [AT] plural [DOT] cafe, or alternatively by direct messaging the administrators listed in the\n@Barkeep\ndescription.\nWhat is Mastodon?\nFrom\njoyeusenoelle's An Increasingly Less-Brief Guide to Mastodon\n:\nMastodon is Twitter-style social networking combined with email-style instanced servers. It's named after the metal band, but themed after the extinct megafauna.\nEach Mastodon instance is independent but networked, like email servers. If you sign up for an email account on gmail.com, you don't automatically have an account on hotmail.com or aol.com, but you can send and receive messages to and from users on hotmail.com and aol.com.\nLikewise, if you sign up for an account on mastodon.social, that doesn't make an account for you on every other instance, but you can talk to users from other instances and they can talk to you.\nWhat is Plurality?\nFrom\nPlurality Resource\n:\nThe most simplified definition of the term plural that includes all people who take the label is “someone who shares the same physical body with other individuals.”  Such a group is sometimes referred to as a system, though many plural groups use different terminology.  Because plurality can take many vastly different forms, it is difficult to expand this definition without excluding someone who might otherwise share characteristics or concerns with most other members of the community.  It does seem this basic trait is the only thing groups of people who refer to themselves as plural universally share.  In other words, there are many, many ways to be plural, and no two systems are the same even as far as basic characteristics.  There are a lot of trends in the community, however, and various types within the umbrella term of plural that seem to be subsets.\nThere is a prevailing theory in the community that sees plurality as a spectrum going from singlet (one person in one physical body) to median (a term describing groups that have one main member plus others who are somewhat separate) to multiple (a group of distinct individuals in which more than one person can take control of the physical body).  Groups who deviate from these subsets are seen as occupying an in-between ground along the spectrum.\nMore information can be found on\nMore Than One\n,\nHealthy Multiplicity\n,\nTulpa.io\n, or the\nBlackbirds' Layman's Guide to Multiplicity\n.\nInstance Rules\nAll new registrations follow\n@Barkeep\nby default, but may unfollow them.

This is not meant to stop survivors from talking about their experiences or consenting adults from talking about similar-looking kink and roleplay experiences.\nnonconsensual sexual activity and sexual assault\nsexual activity involving minors and folks in bodies under the age of 18 (including fictional depictions)\nsexual activity involving animals\n\nThe following kinds of content, and encouraging or promoting them, are not permitted and are subject to removal:\nCredible threats of violence\nDoxxing and other kinds of privacy violation\nCopyright and other intellectual property infringement\nPromoting or selling illegal drugs\nOther content illegal in New Jersey, the United States, or that would cause us to break the terms of service of our hosting provider Linode.\n\nThese rules may change at any time.\n\nValues\nPlural.cafe aims to be a welcoming space for all plural systems and plural-friendly singlets. Our goal is to create and maintain a space that is:\n\ninclusive of all kinds of systems\nincluding but not limited to traumagenic, endogenic, and tulpamancy systems, as well as those who do not care or do not know their origins\nincluding disordered, undiagnosed, and non-disordered systems\nagainst sysmedicalism / anti-endogenic attitudes\n\nwelcoming to all kinds of headmates\nalterhuman friendly\nincluding nonhuman, otherkin, therian, fictive, furry, etc. experiences\n\nqueer and lgbt+ friendly\nnonbinary inclusive\naromantic and asexual inclusive\nagainst transmedicalism\n\naccepting of just generally being\nweird\n\nanti-racist\nanti-sexist\nagainst gender essentialism\n\nanti-fascist\nanti-ableist\nanti-classist\nanti-harassment\nnote that posting screenshots of other people's toots with the intent of mocking or enabling harassment against them (\"screenshot dunking\") is considered harassment\nposting screenshots of other people's toots to warn others about their behavior is\nnot\nharassment\nblock evasion (using another account to talk to someone who has blocked you) is harassment, even when the block is of a different headmate\n\nbody positive\nsex and kink positive\nKeep in mind that this instance and the fediverse at large are shared spaces with minors and sex-repulsed or traumatized individuals.

They do not have to be content warned on \"followers-only\" posts on locked accounts that mention them in the bio or a pinned toot. Images with these must be marked sensitive.\n\nthe covid-19/coronavirus pandemic\nabuse\nalcohol\nbody fluids\ndeath\ndrugs\nfood and eating\nflashing or rapidly moving images\ngenitalia\ngraphic violence and gore\nmisinformation and unreality\nself harm\nsex and/or kink\nWe recommend *not* using \"nsfw\" in your content warning.\n\nsexual assault\nsuicide and ideation\n\nNote that discussion of politics, racism, other forms of oppression, venting, etc. are *not* on this list. We still recommend being considerate of your fellow café-goers and using content warnings for potentially sensitive, hurtful, or triggering posts.\nTechnical note\n: an image-only toot cannot have a content warning. We recommend using a single \".\", 🖼️, or other character in the toot body so that it displays properly.\nBot & Automated Posts Policies\nIn addition to the above, these rules apply to automated posts and bot accounts.\n\nAutomated posts (e.g. bot posts and Twitter crossposts) should not have the \"public\" privacy setting.\nBots must not follow or interact with users who haven't opted in or interacted with them. Opt-out with the \"#nobot\" tag is not enough.\nBots must have the \"This is a bot account\" option set in their profile.\n\nModeration Tools\nThese are the tools available to moderators for resolving rules violations. Except for particularly severe cases, no action will be taken against local user accounts without discussion or warning. Beyond that, the exact tools used will depend on the situation and are up to moderator discretion.\n\nMarking images as sensitive\nDeleting toots\nDeleted toots may still be accessible on other instances, but will no longer appear on plural.cafe.\n\nDiscussion with the user(s) involved\nWarning\nTemporarily disable login (for local accounts)\nSilence\nToots from a silenced account do not appear on the local or federated timeline.\n\nSuspend\nThis deletes a local account. Deleted local accounts cannot be recovered.\nFor a remote account, the server effectively pretends the account does not exist. No toots can be sent to or from that account and it will not be searchable.\n\n\nFederation Policy\nPlural Café will reject media from, silence, and/or suspend instances whose users repeatedly or flagrantly violate our server rules. We also suspend instances that knowingly and intentionally federate with known harassers on the Fediverse, like Gab and Kiwifarms.\nThe full block list is presented below so that people on Plural Café or interested in joining are aware of the restrictions we impose on federation.\nDomain blocks\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse. These are the exceptions that have been made on this particular server.\nFiltered media\nMedia files from these instances will not be processed or stored, and no thumbnails will be displayed,

If you don't want to get it, maybe find somewhere else to hang your hat.\nOwn Your Weird\nThis is a space to celebrate our diversity. Be true to yourself and let others do the same.\n\nShare Your Weird\nTalk about the weird shit you're into! Talk to other people about the weird shit they're into! Make weird shit together! Post your art! Bots welcome!\n\nCultivate the Weird\nHarassment will not be tolerated, oppressive behavior will not be tolerated, and while failure to recognize the boundaries of others may be met at first with a gentle attempt to educate you, repeated failure will not be tolerated.\n\nKeep weirder.earth Weird!\nNo brands, no marketing, no data-miners. You're here to use it for its social function, not to exploit it for some other purpose.\n\nBanal Bullshit Unwelcome\nThere's nothing interesting about homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism, ableism or any of the other unexamined default settings some people grow up with. Being a nazi isn't weird, it's shitty and aggressively boring - take it somewhere else. You can feel free to disagree somewhere else where none of us have to hear you. Enforced strictly.\n\nMore information\nWe have a page that gets a little more specific about this that you should take the time to read if you're thinking of joining.\nYou can read it here.\n\n\n\nQueries\nIf you run into registration trouble, contact\nEldang\n,\nLouInABox\n,\nMcmoots\nor\nZ\nhere, or\nMykola on Twitter\nfor help.\nIf you have any moderation-related queries, contact\nAmazey\n,\nDistel\n,\nLouInABox\n,\nZ\n,\nMcmoots\n,\nEldang\n, and\nrabbithearth\n.\n\n\n\nInstance blocks\nAs you might know, Mastodon is made of many instances that 'federate' with each other to deliver you users and toots from many different places. However, not all of these instances actually do federate with each other and sometimes, instances actively block other instances, like we do.\nWe do this because there are instances that shelter people who have negative or threatening ideologies or behaviour. It's to protect our users from hate, harassment and general bullshit when we can't cooperate with an instance's administration on moderation issues.\nThere are also other reasons that we block, like to make sure we're not breaking the laws that other instances may not share with us.\nWe started out following\nBLOCKchain\n(apart from corporate instances), but we have continued updating our block list since that project stopped being actively maintained. Most of our blocks are suspensions.\n\n\n\nCredits\n\nThis instance uses\nMutant Standard emoji\n, which are licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License\n.\nThis instance also uses emoji made by Hezekiah (\n@metapianycist@queer.party\n) and Pamela (\n@pamela@bsd.network\n).\nThis instance uses Pokémon emoji, which were converted to Mastodon format by\nSiphonay\n/\ndonphan.social\n.\nUnavailable content\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

The other endpoint is a human being with an inner life just as complex as your own. Act accordingly.\nConsider the reach of the posts you make. Tag content that you expect others might not want to see.\nHarassment and bullying of any kind are not tolerated here. Do not engage with a user if they do not want you to. Do not ask other users to, either.\n\nDon’t start shit.\n\nDo not make posts just to get angry reactions.\n“I was being ironic” is an extremely flimsy excuse for behaving badly.\nDo not drag unrelated people into a discussion.\n\nObey the law.\n\nSpecifically, Dutch (server location) and German (owner location) law.\nNo illegal file sharing, no illegal pornography, no publication of personal protected information, no holocaust denial, you know the drill.\n\nSpam is not allowed.\n\nBots that interact with a user without a users explicit request are not allowed.\nAutomated or excessive advertising is not allowed.\n\nBe aware of the nature of the network.\n\nThis website is part of a network of similar websites. Other websites may have different rules.\nThe local administration has little control over users of other websites. You can, however, block and mute them - same as local users.\nIn egregious cases, remote users or entire groups of users may be blocked from interacting with users of this website.\n\nFascism is incompatible with a free exchange of ideas.\n\nWhen you endorse racism, exclusion and the structural and physical violence that come with it, you show yourself to not be interested in any sort of dialogue.\nThose who work towards a society based on chauvinism and nationalism rather than peaceful coexistance are not welcome here.\n\nAdmin decisions are final.\n\nThe interpretation of these rules is up to the administration and an admins decision overrides the rules.\n“Technically I did not violate any rule” is an extremely flimsy excuse for behaving badly.\nThe rules may be changed or amended when necessary.\n\nThese goal of these rules is to ensure a safe and welcoming environment.\n\nRule enforcement is guided by this goal.\nAny enforcement action will generally be kept between those involved.\nTry to self-moderate, but do not hesitate to involve an admin when necessary.\nThere are presently two people with administrative access to the website, @halcy, @dotUser .\nYou can report rule violations via the report function, or via e-mail.\nYou can find information about our\nterms of service and privacy policy here.\nInstance mascot\nThe\ninstance mascot\nwas drawn by\nてむれい\n.\nGermany legal notice\nWe are now hosted in a German data center.

Qualquer pessoa pode fazer uma conta aqui, mas não se surpreenda ao encontrar poucas pessoas hétero, cis e perissexo.\nLevamos nossas regras a sério; por favor,\nleia todas as nossas regras antes de fazer sua conta\n.\nColorid.es é principalmente para pessoas que falam português, mas pessoas que não falam português ou que vão postar em múltiplas línguas são bem-vindas!\nIncluímos pessoas queer, intersexo, transgênero, não-binárias, de orientações multi, heteroflexíveis, do espectro assexual, do espectro arromântico, de atração fluida, xenogênero, poligênero, do espectro agênero, que não são hétero por conta de sua orientação sensual/queerplatônica/alternativa, astroidianas, asterianas, cujos gêneros são influenciados por culturas/crenças/experiências de vida, entre outras, como parte da comunidade. Seu ódio por elas não é negociável independentemente de sua identidade, e resultará em banimento.\nSe você quer uma introdução melhor à instância e ao Mastodon,\nconfira sobre.colorid.es\n!\nNossas regras\n0. A moderação da instância possui o direito de deletar qualquer brilho/toot/tute (postagem) ou conta, ou de silenciar/bloquear qualquer instância, se percebermos que estão causando mais mal do que bem à comunidade.\nIsto se aplica principalmente a quando as regras abaixo são quebradas, mas também se aplica a casos não previstos nelas.\n1. Tudo o que for contra a lei brasileira é proibido aqui.\n2. Tudo o que for postado será de responsabilidade de cada postadore.\nDetalhes:\nCaso outra pessoa faça uma infração pela sua conta, é você quem deve ser cuidadose da próxima vez.\nCaso haja alguma infração legal, a responsabilidade não é da equipe do site.\nCaso você faça algo contra as regras em outra conta desta instância, sua conta ainda pode ser punida.\n\n3. Atitudes preconceituosas ou propositalmente irritantes não serão toleradas.\nDetalhes:\nHá um limite entre perpetuar algum preconceito por acidente por ser a atitude padrão da sociedade e entre insistir que tal atitude é inofensiva/\"senso comum\".\nHá um limite entre fazer perguntas e insistência em não entender porque algo é nocivo a um certo grupo de pessoas.\nHá um limite entre fazer uma brincadeira sem saber que alguém se incomodaria e entre insistir na brincadeira porque é só uma brincadeira.\nHá um limite entre querer se expressar e entre postar repetidamente mensagens curtas e/ou repetitivas e essencialmente sem conteúdo novo. Se quiser ficar fazendo spam, use a opção para postagens não listadas, ou opções de postagens privadas.\nMesmo que não seja em relação a uma opressão/discriminação existente, aparente ou conhecida, tente não julgar pessoas por comportamentos \"estranhos\", \"ridículos\" ou \"infantis\" quando isso não te afeta. Casos extremos disso podem levar a ações da moderação.\n\n4. Evite brigas.\nDetalhes:\nCaso alguém esteja agindo mal, argumente sem depender de insultos vagos, bloqueie e/ou denuncie.\nMesmo que algum lugar tenha tomado decisões ruins em relação a uma pessoa ou grupo, aqui não é o lugar de organizar \"invasões\" contra outros espaços.\nCaso alguém exponha algum canal de comunicação de uma pessoa problemática, não pense que é uma boa ideia enviar mensagens com sugestões violentas para a pessoa. Caso seja descoberto que tais mensagens venham desta instância, é possível que ações sejam tomadas contra isso na instância.\n\n5.

Talvez seja bom deixar o conteúdo dentro de aviso de conteúdo, caso você não tenha certeza.\n\n\nNão é necessário utilizar avisos de conteúdo para outros tipos de conteúdos ou assuntos, mas recomendamos que os utilizem sempre que perceber que outras pessoas possam não querer engajar com o conteúdo das suas postagens, ou querer conhecimento prévio de seus conteúdos antes disso.\n6. Caso você queira fazer uma conta completamente automatizada (\"bot\"), que seja apenas para anúncios/propaganda, ou cujo conteúdo principal pode estar \"em cima da linha\" do que é permitido ou não, por favor contate a administração com antecedência, para que possamos indicar o que você pode ou não pode fazer.\n\n7.

Anyone can make an account, but don't be surprised if you encounter few het, cis and perisex people here. We take our rules serioulsy, so please read that section before making an account.\nAlso, this is an instance primarily for Portuguese speakers. People who don't speak Portuguese or who will also speak in other languages are welcome, though, as long as our moderation team can handle it!\nWe include people who are queer, intersex, transgender, nonbinary, multi-oriented (m-spec), heteroflexible, asexual spectrum, aromantic spectrum, fluid, xenogender, polygender, agender spectrum, non-het regarding sensual/alterous/queerplatonic orientation, astroidian, asterian, non-cis because of culture/belief/life experience, and others in the community. Your hatred for them is not tolerable regardless of your own identity, and will result on a ban.\nThis instance's moderation team has the right of deleting any toot (post) or account, if we notice it's causing the community more harm than good. See the rules to know more.\nIf you don't think this instance is for you,\ntake a look at this list\nor\nthis one\nto find other good servers.\n\nAbout Mastodon\nDon't know what Mastodon or the Fediverse are? Check out these guides:\n\nWhat Is Mastodon? (And Why You, A Leftist, Should Be On It)\nToot How-To: Intro to Mastodon\nFederated Sites\nMastodon 101: A Queer-Friendly Social Network You’re Gonna Like a Lot\nMastodon instances, and the ones I recommend\ndelve’s Mastodon Resource List\n\nOur rules\n0. This instance's moderation/administration staff reserves the right to delete any toot (post) or account, and the right to block/silence any instance, if we decide those are doing more harm than good to the community.\nThis usually applies to posts/users/instances that break the following rules, but may also apply to cases which are unaccounted for.\n1. Anything against Brazilian law is not allowed here.\n2. Everything posted by you is your responsibility.\n\nIf someone else goes against the rules on your account, you are the one who should be more careful next time.\nIf you post anything that's against the law, this is not the responsibility of colorid.es' staff.\nIf you do anything against the rules of this instance on another account, your account may still be punished.\n\n3. Bigoted and/or annoying attitudes won't be tolerated.\n\nThere is a limit between contributing to oppression on accident because of society's default views and insisting on contributing to oppression because you think certain opinions are \"not a big deal\" or \"common sense\".\nThere is a limit between asking questions and insisting on not understanding why something is bad to a certain group of people.\nThere is a limit between joking around without knowing someone could get offended and insisting on \"joking around\" because \"it's not serious\".\nThere is a limit between wanting to express oneself and posting many repetitive and/or short messages with essentially no new content. If you want to spam, use the private or unlisted options.\nEven if it doesn't have to do with known kinds of discrimination/oppression, try not to judge people for \"strange\", \"ridiculous\" ou \"childish\" behavior when it doesn't affect you. Extreme cases of this may lead to moderation action.\n\n4. Avoid fights.\n\nIf someone is acting in bad faith, argue without resorting to vague/baseless insults, block the person and/or report them.\nEven if somewhere else someone made bad decisions regarding a person or group, here is not the place to plan \"raids\" against other spaces.\nIf someone exposes a way to communicate with someone that did something problematic, don't think it's a good idea to send messages with violent suggestions to them. If such messages come from this instance, we may take action against this on here.\n\n5. Use content warnings when necessary.\nContent that needs labeling includes:\nPolitics (as in elections and government decisions)\nBlood/gore/violence\nSexual content or content with sexual connotations\nAbuse, bullying, suicide, stalking, eugenicism and other negative situations people may want to avoid reading or seeing images about, especially because of their own past experiences\nDiscussions or warnings about epidemics, pandemics and natural disasters (or other similar dangerous events such as fires) that are ongoing or in recent memory\nDiscussion or mentions of incest\nNegative experiences regarding discrimination (racism, ableism, misogyny, dyadism, heterosexism, cissexism, exorsexism, monossexism, antisemitism, xenomisia, classism, whoremisia, against non-monogamous people, etc.)\nAlcohol/drugs\nSpoilers regarding media that has been out for less than 7 days:\nIf such media is a videogame, a movie, an episode of a reality show/cartoon/series, a book/text/video/audio which contains a fictional or real story that may be \"spoiled\" if someone tells its development or ending: content warnings for spoilers are mandatory;\nIf such media is an ad, an academic publication, a journalistic article/show, or a video/text/audio/image that's meant to be informative and that doesn't contain any story that may be \"spoiled\" if its development or ending is told: content warnings for spoilers aren't needed, unless such media spoils something that applies to the item above;\nIf such media doesn't fit either or fits both of the descriptions above, use common sense. And if you still aren't sure, maybe put the content inside a spoiler content warning anyways.\n\n\nIt's not mandatory to use content warnings for other kinds of contents or subjects, but we recommend using them as much as you think it's worth it. See what other people content warn, for instance.\n6. If you want to make an account with the purpose of posting automated content (\"bot\"), advertising or other kinds of \"borderline against the rules\" content, please contact the staff beforehand, so we can tell you how you can proceed.\n\n7. Don't steal content, and respect artists'/creators' wishes.\nDetails:\nIf someone doesn't want their content to be reposted, don't repost it.\nUnless the content is explicitly marked as something that doesn't need attribution (such as public domain content), every book/song citation, video, image (including avatar/header), ASCII art, etc. needs to be credited, either by a link to the artist's profile, a link to somewhere that properly attributes the content or by citing an artist's name and/or the work's name, unless the work is your own.\nIf an artist asks you to remove their art from your profile or avatar, you'll have to remove it.\n\nInstances with completely different rules than ours may be blocked. However, slight rule differences (with regards to content warnings for certain things, for instance) may be tolerated.

An instance for those who love to make and/or eat food!\nYour friendly neighborhood admin is\n@mdszy\nWe run glitch-soc with a character limit of 5000 to make it easier to post full recipes and such!\nInstance-specific rules\nContent Warning Policy\n\nCW'ing of food is not required! Any post made on the instance without a CW will have the CW \"auto cw: could contain food\" when it federates. However, the post will appear non-CW'd on this instance itself. This allows us to not have to CW and click through every post, while still protecting folks on other instances who wish to have food content behind a CW.\n\nHowever,\ncursed\nfood (i.e. food posts that are meant as humor and would probably be considered gross)\nmust\nbe CW'd.\n\nCW'ing of meat or non-vegan content is recommended.\nCocktails/homebrewing are incredibly valid forms of cooking too! However, please CW alcohol-related content appropriately.\n\nOther Instance-specific policies.\n\nThe best way to cook, bake, eat or otherwise enjoy something is\nthe way that specific person enjoys it\n. That is, gatekeeping will not be tolerated.\nThis instance is for folks who cook/bake/etc. of all skill levels! Do not disparage beginners. Be respectful and helpful.\nDo not use any method of crossposting from Twitter or other social networks to Too Many Cooks.\nSignups are approval-only. This is to prevent spam. If applicable, please mention any other fedi account you might consider your \"main\" to make approvals easier.\n\nAll around rules\n\nNo advertising or excessive promotion.\nNo bots without prior approval.\nNo pornography.\nNo gore or graphic violence.\nFood preparation involving raw meat could be considered an exception to this. Always CW content of this kind.\nContent that is NSFW or borderline NSFW must be put behind a CW.\nNo racism, sexism, ableism, transphobia, nationalism, fascism, or sympathizing with or advocating for any of these things or related things.\nNo Nazis or related symbolism.\nRespect boundaries. If someone asks you to stop interacting with them, stop. If someone blocks or mutes you, do not attempt to evade that action in any way.\nNo stalking, harassment, dogpiling or any other action that is meant to intimidate anyone.\nAny other unethical content is disallowed and will be left to the discretion of the admin(s).\nJust don't be a dingus.\nDo not scrape any content from the web interface or API.\n\nReporting\nIt is best to err on the side of reporting content you think may be breaking rules. Reports will be kept anonymous. Do not, however, make bad-faith reports or spam reports on clearly non-rule-breaking posts. Feel free to report content that isn't on the instance itself, but that appears on the Federated timeline and would be considered breaking our rules.\nFederation policies\nWe do not federate with overtly fascist instances or instances that associate with them. Feel free to let the admins know if you have a problem with this policy so they can defederate with you, too.\nPrivacy Reminders\n\nThis instance uses HTTPs everywhere thanks to Let's Encrypt.\nNew users of the site are opted out of search engine indexing by default. Note that this relies on the search engine itself respecting this setting, so it's not foolproof.\nNo ads, trackers or analytics of any kind are used on Too Many Cooks.\nUnderstand that this instance admins have access to all data submitted to, and all data that federates with this site. Data is not encrypted, this includes followers-only and DM posts.\n\nMedia Storage\nThis isn't so much a rules section as it is thanking Jortage for providing the media storage for the instance!\n\n\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

However due to the nature of the\nFediverse\nI can not guarantee a\nsafespace\n.\nTo do this I expect that people use content warnings following the usual Mastodon etiquette; for example for politics, 'adult'/lewd content, eye contact, food, mental health ... if in doubt ask first please!\nI frequently check the local and federated timelines to make sure the rules are kept to, and block and silence instances who do not meet my expectations. I also monitor behaviour from other instance accounts so that I can block and silence preventatively.\nThere is no tolerance for harassment or discrimination of any kind, directly or indirectly. For example, this includes racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia and TERF shit, fascism, general channer garbage, and so on.\nRespect each others' privacy choices.\nPlease remember that the Anglophone web is not the USA, and that others' will have different cultural expectations and practices. Let's all respect each others'.\nNB: This isn't meant as a dog whistle, just trying to say that just because something aint offensive in one place doesn't mean it aint a problem elsewhere.\nAlways remember that we're here to encourage and support each other, and hopefully make pals (and make videogames less bad)!\nIf you make an account that's just for promoting your game without any interest in engaging with other people (IE SPAM) I will very probably delete it.\n\nOther Guidelines and Notes\n\ngamemaking.social does not claim ownership of anything you post. You retain full rights.\nAccount deletion by owners is enabled.\nThere's no Google stuff or anything else gross. In your adblocker you'll just need to make sure gamemaking.social and cf.mastohost.com (media storage) are allowed.\nWe're hosted on\nmasto.host\n, on the 'niche' plan. I believe the servers are in so-called Canada and France.\nAdmin accounts are:\n@blueberrysoft\nand\n@gamemakingtools\n.\nDon't forget to make an\n#introductions\npost :D\nIn the event of me wanting to abandon owning this instance I will happily pass it on to a new admin :)\n\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse. These are the exceptions that have been made on this particular server.\nSilenced servers\nPosts from these servers will be hidden in public timelines and conversations, and no notifications will be

        "aboutMore": "\nOur Goal\nThis community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.\nApplicability and Scope\nThis code of conduct applies to all of this community's spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.\nToward a Welcoming and Safe Environment\nWe hope to create an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and interact in a positive and affirming way. Examples of behavior that contributes to creating this sort of environment include:\n* Using welcoming and inclusive language\n* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n* Focusing on what is best for the overall community\n* Showing empathy towards other community members\nAnti-Harassment Statement\nThis community will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Examples of harassment include:\n* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, pregnancy status, veteran status, political affiliation, marital status, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker. This includes anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.\n* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.\n* Deliberate misgendering, using inappropriate pronouns, or use of \"dead\" or rejected names.\n* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they're not appropriate.\n* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like \"hug\" or \"backrub\") without consent or after a request to stop.\n* Threats of violence.\n* Incitement of violence towards any individual or group, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.\n* Deliberate intimidation.\n* Stalking or following - online or in the physical world.\n* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.\n* Sustained disruption of discussion.\n* Unwelcome sexual attention.\n* Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.\n* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.\n* Deliberate \"outing\" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.\n* Publication of non-harassing private communication.\n* Jokes that resemble the above, such as \"hipster racism\", still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.\nIf you have questions or concerns about these issues please feel free to message an admin or ask for an opportunity to explore the issue with a moderator and volunteers.\nReporting\nIf you are being harassed by a member of our community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the administrators @ldopa or @jackdaw_ruiz via Direct Message (DM). If the person who is harassing you is on the admin team, they will not be involved in handling or resolving the incident.\nThe admin team will respond to any complaint as promptly as possible we can. If you do not get a timely response (for example, if no admins are currently online) then please put your personal safety and well-being first, and consider logging out and/or contacting the admins by email at admin@myasstodon.xyz.\nThis code of conduct applies to our community's spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by our members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces and behavior towards people who are not in this community.\nIn order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.\nEnforcement Process\nEvery code of conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care. If a member's immediate safety and security is threatened, an individual admin may take any action that they deem appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from the community. In less urgent situations, at least two admins will discuss the offense and mutually arrive at a suitable response, which will be shared with the offender privately. Whatever the resolution that they decide upon, the decision of the admins involved in a violation case will be considered final.\nWe will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of our members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.\nConsequences\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community and identification of the participant as a harasser to other members. At the discretion of the admins, or by request, one or more of the parties involved may request to discuss the violation and how to avoid similar situations in the future.\nAcknowledgements\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Community Covenant (http://community-covenant.net), version 1.0, available at http://community-covenant.net/version/1/0/.

Feel free to hit me up if you have any questions or requests, be it about this instance, how to make your own instance, or other things not related to Mastodon.\nI am actually the only sysadmin of this instance and I can't work full-time on oldbytes.space so, I will do whatever I can in a reasonable time to make it works the best it can.\nRules\nThis instance has some rules, of course.\nFirst, the usual : no sexism, no racism, no hate speech, no LGBTQphobia, no nazis, no spam, no public unflagged porn, etc...\nThen, I also believe it's important to remind you that this server was made and is being run by a queer activist.\nThis server thrives to be inclusive, and I will ban without much regret.\nPeople are encouraged to use the report function as they see fit, and can be confident that their complaints will be heard and dealt with in some way. I want everyone to feel safe here, and if that doesn't sound like something you like, you should probably find another server.\nThere's also a pretty important activism aspect of this instance.\nIf you're a marketer, or a #digital #influencer, this is not the place for you. Not only do I feel you should not feel welcome, I intend to make you feel definitely NOT welcome.\nThis instance, and this entire social network in my opinion, is dedicated to reclaiming social media, decentralizing, and generally creating better and more engaging communities.\nThe three categories of people I mentioned earlier are not, in my opinion, working towards this goal, pretty much the opposite, and they are not welcome on this server.\nPlease report them if you see them.\nWe also block Nazis, techbros and RMS.\nSpecs\nCurrently running on\nHetzner Cloud\nhardware.\nOne CX31-CEPH with Nginx, Mastodon WEB, Mastodon Sidekiq and Minio as a S3 assets manager endpoint, PostgreSQL and Redis.\nYou can take a look at the Grafana (Telegraf) graphs metrics\nHERE\n.\nBackups are taken one time per day using the dedicated paid option of Hetzner.\n\nTerms\nThe server is hosted in Falkenstein\nThe only logs created are the ones from: nginx, mastodon (nodejs, puma web server, sidekiq) and minio (assets).\nThere is no retention currently in place except the by-default on Debian.\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

It’s cool to have a little trash talk between rivals, but don’t take it too far and don’t make it personal.\n\nAllpro is a place to discuss sports, sports related things, etc. General stuff is fine (if you're watching the game with friends, you don't *only* talk about the game after all), but try to keep on topic.\n\nThere are a lot of complicated feelings towards the names and logos of certain major league sports teams. Fans of those teams are welcome to share in the joy of sports with us, but\nwhenever possible, avoid the use of team names, logos, or fan chants/displays that have a history in racist stereotypes\nincluding the nickname of Washington's NFL team and the caricature logo of Cleveland's MLB team. Usage of hashtags such as ‘HTTR’ are fine. I know mistakes will be made, but repeated or clearly intentional use will result in administrative action\n\nif you think any of these rules encroach on your free speech, well, tough shit. Also, and I say this emphatically, if you're a Nazi, a bigot or otherwise a hate-peddler? Take a hike.

Respect other users' privacy and ability to curate their own experience online.\n- No hate speech, aggressive nationalism, or right wing sympathies of any kind. This includes racism, sexism, mysoginy, homophobia, transphobia, antisemitism, casteism, white supremacy, corporate or police bootlicking, fascism, or discrimination of any kind.\n- Please try your best use content warnings on your sensitive posts. Some examples of CWs: politics(pol), NSFW/lewd/kink, food/diet/weight, physical & mental health(ph & mh), weapons/violence/death, eye contact(ec), all caps, emoji spam/screen reader inaccessible.\n- Do not demand CWs from other users. Block and report if you have to, but do not try to police someone else's experience. If it's a genuine problem it will fall to the mods.\n- No inappropriate (sexual or otherwise) behavior towards or from individuals under the age of 18. All lewdness must be between consenting adults.\n- No \"brand\" content. We are people here, not companies. Showing and even selling your own work is okay, as long as you're not just advertising.\n- Good spam is ok\n- Try to be nice to each other :)\n- You are solely responsible for the consequences of anything you post, be it on here or in the real world. The final decision on if something violates the CoC will be at the discretion of the mods.

Deshalb haben wir einige Regeln aufgestellt, die ein friedliches Miteinander sicher stellen.\nMehr über die Forschungsgemeinschaft elektronische Medien e.V. erfährst du auf\nunserer Homepage\n.\nSupport\nBei Fragen oder Problemen bezüglich dieser Mastodon Instanz, kannst du dich direkt an unseren Instanzen-Account\n@toot@fem.social\nwenden. Alternativ haben wir auch eine\nE-Mail Adresse\n.\nViele Informationen haben wir auch auf unserer\nSupport Seite\nschon zusammengefasst.\nSupport Seite\nRules\n\"Be excellent to each other\" is easier said than done, and means different things to different people.\nThe following rules are a (non-exhaustive) list of behaviours that may lead to deletion of toots, silencing or suspension of accounts, at the descretion of the instance administrators.\nPlease report behaviour that bothers you. We will keep your report confidential.\n\nWe do not tolerate harrassment, stalking, and doxxing.\nWe do not tolerate racism, sexism, verbal abuse, discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or the advocation of any of these.\nWe do not tolerate violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism or promoting the ideology of National Socialism.\nDo not contact people who made clear they want no contact. This includes dogpiling/brigading.\nPosts with sexual content or gore have to be tagged.\nAdvertisements have to be tagged, and must not be excessive or automated.\nAutomated posts should be unlisted (rendering visible to everybody, but not appearing on the local timeline) to keep the local timeline of our instance a place of community dialogue and human interaction. This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter \"retweets\" and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions.\nBots may only interact with a user when they're invited by that user to do so.\nIf you need to post with a high frequency, please set your posts to be unlisted to keep the local timeline readable.\nIn discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you're talking to, and try to avoid irony, sarcasm, or similar modes of language – they typically don't translate well to written language and tend to escalate discussions or misunderstandings.\n\nRules are stolen from\nchaos.social\n;P\nNicht verfügbarer Inhalt\nMastodon erlaubt es dir generell, mit Inhalten zu interagieren, diese anzuzeigen und mit anderen Nutzern im Fediversum über Server hinweg zu interagieren.

Was das Gesetz verbietet (deutsches und österreichisches Recht), ist also auch bei uns nicht erlaubt – ganz simpel! Meinungsvielfalt ist ein zentrales Element eines progressiven Diskurses, jedoch lässt sich oft kaum vermeiden, dass bei unterschiedlichen Meinungen die Wogen hoch gehen. Wir sind uns bewusst, dass es beinahe zu jeder Angelegenheit zwei völlig widerstreitende Ansichten geben mag. Genau deshalb sollten wir unbedingt Rücksicht aufeinander nehmen.\nVerhaltenskodizes\nDiese Empfehlungen möchten wir euch daher geben:\n\nBevor ihr etwas mit anderen Usern teilt, fragt euch, wie sie es verstehen könnten oder ob es etwas ist, was ihr auch wollen würdet, dass eure Mütter oder Kinder zu sehen bekommen.\nInterpretiert konträre Meinungen anderer so wohlwollend und stark wie möglich.\nFragt im Zweifel besser einmal „zu viel“ nach, wie etwas gemeint war.\nHaltet euch vor Augen, dass hinter jedem Blogeintrag, Post, jedem Kommentar usw. ein Mensch steht, der ganz unterschiedlich Lebenserfahrungen gemacht hat.\nFolgt dem Prinzip, dass man niemanden dadurch von der eigenen Ansicht überzeugt, indem man sich höher stellt als ihn, sich lustig macht oder ätzt.\n\nBeständigkeit des Dienstes\n\nManchmal werden Dienstleistungen stillgelegt, das ist der Kreislauf des Lebens. Gründe könnten sein, dass uns die Administration einfach zu viel wird, oder die Spenden die Kosten für die Server lange nicht decken können. Um Gewissheit zu haben, dass das Konto auf graz.social nicht über Nacht verschwindet, damit man Zeit hat, seine Daten zu exportieren und einen anderen Server zu finden, versprechen wir eine eventuelle Stilllegung mindestens drei Monate im voraus an zu kündigen.\nWeiters machen wir tägliche Backups, um den Verlust von Daten vorzubeugen.\n\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

Es ist dazu gedacht, alle Mitglieder dieser Community vor Belästigung zu schützen und sicherzustellen, dass unsere Community so inklusiv wie möglich bleibt. Dies ist ein Work-in-Progress Dokument, also nimmt sich das darmstadt.social Team die Freiheit heraus es an die Gegebenheiten anzupassen.\nZiele\n\nBiete allen eine freundliche, sichere und inklusive Umgebung, unabhängig von Wissensstand, Gender-Identität, sexueller Orientierung, Beeinträchtigung, Erscheinungsbild, Körpergröße, Ethnizität, Alter, religiöser Zugehörigkeit, Nationalität, politischer Orientierung, oder anderer ähnlicher Charakteristika.\nBiete eine unterstützende Umgebung, in der sich alle Menschen ihrer Passion hingeben können und sich positiv mit anderen über Freud und Leid des Lebens austauschen können.\nBiete einen Ort für lockere Gespräche — wir sind alle Teil der Darmstädter Region, was aber nicht bedeutet, dass es ausschließlich um lokale Themen gehen muss.\nKomme zusammen mit deiner Nachbarschaft. Diese Instanz wird in erster Linie von Darmstädtern für Darmstädter betrieben. Menschen sollen sich über diese Plattform kennenlernen, treffen und zusammen etwas in Darmstadt bewegen können.\n\nAnti-Ziele\nWährend es wichtig ist, zu wissen, was darmstadt.social ist, ist es genauso wichtig zu wissen, was nicht. darmstadt.social ist\nnicht\n:\n\nEine Zone freier Meinungsäußerung. darmstadt.social ist eine Community mit bestimmten — und hohen — Verhaltensstandards. Möchtest Du von deinem vollständigen Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung gebrauch machen, kannst Du das gerne\nwoanders tun\n; Solange Du auf darmstadt.social unterwegs bist, solltest Du die Regeln dieses Codex beachten.\nEine Nur-Darmstadt Zone. Wir alle haben unsere Gründe, in Darmstadt zu leben oder uns hier heimisch zu fühlen. Es sollte aber kein darmstadt.social Nutzer aufgrund seiner Herkunft oder des Wohnortes ausgeschlossen werden.\n\nWissenswertes\nÖffentliches Tröten\nÖffentliche Toots werden in der öffentlichen Timeline veröffentlicht. Das heißt insbesondere, dass Deine Toots auf der lokalen Timeline und der \"\nWas in Darmstadt abgeht\n\"-Seite erscheinen und somit für jeden im Internet sichtbar sind. Das heißt auch, dass deine Toots sichtbar sind in allen Instanzen mit denen darmstadt.social föderiert.\nNicht-Öffentliches Tröten\nWenn Du nicht möchtest, dass Deine Toots auf darmstadt.social auf der öffentlichen Timeline erscheinen, kannst Du folgende Privatsphäreeinstellungen nutzen:\n\nNicht gelistet\n- Wird nicht auf öffentlichen Timelines gepostet, kann aber über dein öffentliches Profil betrachtet werden.\n\nNur für Folgende\n- Wird nur für dir folgende sichtbar sein.\n\nDirektnachricht\n- Wird nur an erwähnte Profile gesendet.\n\nNutzer, die dir folgen, haben bewusst zugestimmt, zu sehen was Du zu sagen versuchst. Über\nNur für Folgende\nsprichst Du direkt zu diesen Menschen und nicht zum größeren Fediverse. Menschen die dir folgen verstehen mit höherer Wahrscheinlichkeit den Kontext und Klang von dem, was Du zu sagen versuchst.\nNutze immer eine Inhaltswarnung an geeigneter Stelle, auch für deine\nNur für Folgende\nund\nDirektnachricht\nToots.\nRegeln\nAuf dieser Seite findet deutsches Recht anwendung. Verstöße werden entsprechend geahndet.\nAlle Toots\nAlle Toots (öffentlich und privat) sollten den folgenden Regeln folgen:\n\nNutze keine\nrassistische\n,\nsexistische\n,\nhomophobe\n,\ntransphobe\n,\nbeeinträchtigtenfeindliche\nund anderweitig\ndiskriminierende\noder\nhasserfüllte Sprache\nbzw. Witze um\nWeiße Vorherrschaft\n,\nAntisemitismus\n, Transphobie oder andere hasserfüllte Ideologien zu bewerben.\nBelästige niemanden und unterlasse persönliche Angriffe. Weder allein noch als Gruppe. Das Veröffentlichen oder die Androhung von Veröffentlichung von\npersonen-identifizierenden Informationen\n(\"\ndoxing\n\") wird als Belästigung ausgelegt.\nPoste keine pornographischen oder sexualisierten Inhalte. Dazu gehören auch Witze und Kommentare.\nVeröffentliche keinen Spam. Ein Toot mit nichts als einem Link wird als Spam ausgelegt, ebenso wie jedwede kommerzielle Werbung. Kommerzielle Werbung in diesem Zusammenhang bedeutet, wenn die veröffentlichten Inhalte keinen persönlichen Bezug aufweisen und eindeutig dazu gedacht sind, direkt oder indirekt Geld zu erwirtschaften.\nNutze keine voll-automatisierten Accounts. Das schließt alle Accounts ein, auf denen mit Automationswerkzeugen geposted, aber nie anders interagiert wird (Antworten, Boosten, etc.). Solange Du ein aktiver Nutzer bist, darfst Du Werkzeuge für automatisches Posten verwenden. (z.B., ein Twitter cross-poster)\n\nÖffentliche Toots\nÖffentliche toots müssen den obigen Regeln folgen und ebenso den folgenden, zusätzlichen Punkten:\n\nVeröffentliche keine Inhalte über kontroverse, aufrührerische Themen ohne eine Inhaltswarnung zu verwenden.\nBegehe keine Scheinargument-Attacken (auch\nad hominem\ngenannt), oder jede andere unhöfliche Handlung; Kritisiere Ideen - aber niemals Menschen.\nDiskutiere Moderationsentscheidungen nicht zuerst in öffentlichen Toots. Wenn Du nicht einverstanden bist wie ein Moderation diesen Kodex interpretiert und anwendet gib der Person eine Chance zur Erklärung und schicke eine Mail an\ndarmstadtsocial@mailbox.org\n.\n\nDenke immer daran, dass deine öffentlichen Inhalte nicht nur von\nbereits existierenden\nMitgliedern gelesen werden, sondern auch von neuen Mitgliedern und Menschen anderer Instanzen, die möglicherweise (noch) nicht den Kontext haben, um zu verstehen was Du zu sagen versuchst. Strebe danach, die lokale Timeline als Repräsentation der inklusiven, freundlichen Community zu erhalten, die wir hier aufbauen wollen.\nBugs\nWir bitten darum Fehler in der Software auf darmstadt.social umgehend zu melden.\nMelden & Moderation\nWenn dir ein Toot auffällt, der diesen Kodex verletzt, melde das\nbitte\n. Es ist gut möglich, dass jemand anderes diesen Inhalt bereits gemeldet hat. Allerdings passiert es schnell, dass alle so denken und\nes am Ende niemand meldet (Zuschauereffekt)\n.\nBots\nFür das betreiben von Bots auf dieser Community gelten die folgenden Regeln:\n\nFür Bots gelten die gleichen Bestimmungen, wie für Personen-Accounts.\nEs muss eine erreichbare Kontaktperson in der Beschreibung des Bots in einem Tabellenfeld 'Kontaktperson' zu finden sein.\nDie Profilbeschreibung muss einen kurzen Text über dessen Sinn und Zweck enthalten.\nBots dürfen lediglich\nNicht gelistet\nposten, um mehr Raum für relevantere, lokale Inhalte zu bieten.\nAusnahme:\nAusschließlich lokale Inhalte.\n\nBots, die diese Regeln nicht erfüllen, werden umgehend gelöscht. Im Zweifelsfall wird mit der Kontaktperson eine Lösung erziehlt.\nVerfahren bei Verstößen\nDas Moderationsteam wird für erhaltene Meldungen immer einen pragmatischen Ansatz wählen. Wenn der Verdacht besteht, dass ein problematischer Inhalt auf darmstadt.social unerwünscht ist, ist es wahrscheinlich, dass dieser Toot entfernt und entsprechend - verhältnismäßig - mit dem Nutzer verfahren wird.\nSperrungen sind immer Personenbezogen. Wird ein Account gesperrt bedeutet dass auch, das diese Sperrungen auf alle Accounts (auch Bots) dieser Person angewendet wird. Neue Accounts sind von dieser Person dann auch nicht mehr zulässig.\nSperren\nUm diese Instanz vor Inhalten aus dem Fediverse zu schützen, die den obigen Regeln wiedersprechen wie beispielsweise auch Spam, nutzen wir Sperren um auffällige Nutzer oder im Extremfall sogar ganze Instanzen zu sperren und damit von darmstadt.social auszuschließen.\nInstanzsperren\nEingeloggte Nutzer können auf dieser Seite die Liste der gesperrten Instanzen inklusive der Begründung einsehen.\nÜber diese Instanz\nKontakt zu den Verantwortlichen\nBetreiber des Dienstes\nAlexander Wellbrock\nGrillparzerstr. 15\nD-64291 Darmstadt\nMastodon: @w4tsn@darmstadt.social\nMatrix: @w4tsn:darmstadt.social\nE-Mail: darmstadtsocial@mailbox.org\nBackup-Administrator\nKurt Knödel\nMastodon: @kurtknoedel@darmstadt.social\nMatrix: @kurtknoedel:darmstadt.social\nPersonen hinter da*.social\nHallo. Mein Name ist Alex. Ich bin Unternehmensgründer aus Darmstadt und verfächter von freier Software und freiem Social Media. Ich betreibe diese Instanz in meiner Freizeit als Darmstädter für andere Darmstädter.\nIch stehe im Kontakt zu anderen Hobby-Administratoren in ganz Deutschland um ein gesundes Netzwerk alternativer Social Media aufzubauen.\nMeine Grundidee ist es, eine Plattform für Darmstädter zu bieten auf der lokal-relevante Themen geteilt werden können. Durch die Architektur der Plattform, ist auch eine Kommunikation über Landes und Bundesgrenzen hinaus möglich. Meine Hoffnung an dieses Projekt ist, Menschen, Vereine, Verwaltung, lokale Bewegungen und Gruppen jeglicher Art zusammen zu bringen.\nDurch meine Erfahrung als CTO und System Administrator hoffe ich eine stabile Plattform betreiben zu können. Mittelfristig werde ich mit öffentlichen Institutionen wie der hda und TU Darmstadt kooperieren, um der Plattform gerecht bleiben zu können. Nichts desto trotz handelt es sich um ein Hobby-Projekt, weswegen ich keine Gewährleistungen geben kann. Dagegen kann ich Transparenz und pro-aktive Maßnahmen bieten und diese für mich sprechen lassen.\nVerbesserungsvorschläge nehme ich gerne an und Diskussionen stehe ich offen gegenüber. Schickt mir einfach eine Mail an\ndarmstadtsocial@mailbox.org\n.\nEinstellen des Dienstes\nDie Betreiber dieser Instanz behalten sich das Recht vor diesen Dienst jederzeit einzustellen. Nach bekanntgabe bleiben fairerweise noch 3 Monate um etwaige Daten zu sichern und einen Account-Umzug durchzuführen.\nTechnische Details\nDiese Instanz von Mastodon bietet die folgenden technischen Features:\n\nRegelmäßige, automatische und PGP-verschlüsselte Backups\nAutomatische Sicherheitsupdates und automatischer CI/CD-gestützter Ausrollprozess von Applikations-Updates\nStandort der Server in Deutschland, Frankfurt - bei der Netcup GmbH\nDatenträger-Verschlüsselung mit LUKS\nBest-Practices bei der Server-Administration vor allem beim Thema Sicherheit.\n\nTeilnahme an Relais\nAlle Nachrichten (Toots), die öffentlich markiert sind und auf der lokalen Zeitleiste erscheinen, werden zusätzlich an ein Relais übergeben und somit in den lokalen Zeitleisten auf teilnehmenden Instanzen eingeblendet. Dies fördert kleinere Instanzen indem mehr Inhalte in der lokalen Zeitleiste angezeigt werden.

        "aboutMore": "\n\nHi Code of Conduct, I'm Dad!\nFatherhood is a spectrum, respect that.\ndads.cool is an instance for dads; if you apply to become a user, it’s expected that you have, had, or are expecting, at least one (human) child—sorry, but pets are not children, no matter how much we love them. Being a father does not mean identifying or being labeled as a man, nor does it mean that you were involved in the conception of the child you take care of. Foster dads, adoptive dads—anyone who cares for a child and identifies as a dad is welcome here. In that spirit, dads.cool welcomes all sexualities, gender identities, races, levels of mobility, and ages.\nIf a user posts a message that mocks, harasses, endangers, threatens, or otherwise puts at risk any other person on the basis of the criteria above, they will be banned from dads.cool. There is not an appeals process.\nReplying to Other Users\nSharing your experiences as a dad is what we’re all here to do, but take care to distinguish between “this is what worked for me” and “this is what you should do.” Whatever the intentions behind it, unsolicited advice—especially involving a user's health and wellness—is often indistinguishable from harassment and will be treated as such. This is especially true when the health or safety of children is concerned. Please ask permission before giving advice to another user.\nGenerally, seek to understand what a user is looking for when they post their feelings. Is it encouragement, explanation, empathy? It never hurts to ask before you post your reply.\nReporting another User\nPlease use the Report button on posts you feel put our community at risk (including those that might come from other instances, but are directed at dads.cool users); it is the easiest way for an admin to identify abuse.\nContent Warnings\nMastodon’s robust support for content warnings (CWs) is a valuable part of the platform. Please consider using CWs for images that might be considered “not safe for work” like nudity or sexual content, for stories of loss or injury, for video in general, and for photos with eye contact.\nWe do not have formal rules around what exactly should or should not be placed under a CW, but repeated posts of sensitive content without them may result in a message from an admin. Before you ask another person to CW something that is disruptive to you, consider whether one of the myriad other options for personal content moderation—muting, blocking, unfollowing, or filtering words—would achieve the result of removing that content from your own timeline.\nA table of CWs in regular use around Mastodon is below:\n\n\nCW\nMeaning\n\n\nec\na photo with eye contact\n\npers\nintimate or personal information\n\nmh\nconcerning mental health, with a - to indicate negative feelings and + for positive\n\nph\nthe same, but with physical health\n\nlewd\nsexually suggestive content\n\nmeta\nreferring to a wider conversation across mastodon\n\npol\npolitical content, often localized with uspol, eupol, asiapol, etc.\n\n\nInstance Blocks\ndads.cool implements the open source \"BLOCKchain\" to block interactions with instances that might put our community at risk. Detailed reasons behind each ban can be found\non the list's GitHub page.\ndads.cool will not federate with any instance associated with the white supremacist platform Gab. dads.cool will not federate with any multi-user instance that lacks a code of conduct or has a code of conduct that does not forbid harassment. Further domain block decisions will be posted on the admin's feed as a local-only post or discussed on our members-only Discord; an invitation will be made available to new members.\nChanges to this Code of Conduct can be tracked on\nthe dads.cool GitHub repository.\n\n",

        "aboutMore": "\n\nFriendly neighborhood cat here to give you some information on the vibe of this instance if you were interested on signing up. Other instances may have a code of conduct along with a moderation staff to enforce the rules of the community. I've decided not to run this instance that way. On this instance, it's run according to how I want it to run. This doesn't mean it's an unfriendly place or that I rule with an iron fist, it just means that I'm the sole staff person, and that will always be the case. And for rules, they're extremely loose because I like giving people tools to curate their own feeds as opposed to trying to manage everyone's feeds for them.\nThat being said, I'll give you a quick idea of what sort of things I'm looking to keep off the local and federated feeds here so you can know in advance if you'll fit in or not.\n- No Nazis, or really any pro fascist, nationalistic hate rhetoric that exists out there\n- We're queer friendly here, so any bigots can find themselves the door out of here\n- You would think I could just put, \"no racism\" here, but a lot of people haven't figured out how to do that yet so I need to say a bit more about it. I'm a white guy, and for some that's an understandable dealbreaker (no hard feelings), but for others I want to stress that I'm gonna do whatever I can to make sure you're comfortable here within reason. If an instance is harassing you repeatedly, they're gone if you let me know. My bullshit capacity is at a all time low. If an instance doesn't want to action their users for their racist bullshit, then I'm not gonna host them here. If it's coming from one of the users here, they're gone. I'm no nonsense and not here to play games or debate those sort of folks. If it bugs you, it'll probably bug me and I'm gonna take care of it regardless of consequences. I don't give a shit about fediverse relationships.\n- That being said, if you're someone who tends to get into a lot of petty internet spats, and want someone to look out for you on the home instance, you might want to keep looking. I'm not gonna tolerate any user harassing users of different instances or repeatedly getting into fights with people. I have no issues kicking you out if I'm getting a lot of reports about your behavior. If you're the one being harassed however, and it's clearly evident, I will take action for you in that case.\n- I have a pretty lax policy when it comes to content warnings. I don't strictly enforce users to use them, but I do encourage people to use them when posting anything that could be potentially triggering for someone. I advocate users using their judgement here, and expect people to use CWs appropriately. I will not force people to use them. I am not omnipresent and don't particularly wish to try to be, so if you see a user not tagging something that is triggering you, I would ask that you just mute them.\n- Speaking of muting people, I really do stress the features given to you by the platform. Instead of posting something you know will start an argument with someone, just block them instead. An entire instance of shitposters is bugging you? Block the whole instance on your own instead of asking me to defederate with them or starting shit with them. I'm not here to manage your feeds when people are annoying or tasteless.\n- Really, just use common sense. If you act like an adult and treat other people like adults, you'll have no issues here.\nI block instances that have no issues hosting content I do not want to see.

There's also no big companies trying to monitor your every move.\nSign up now\nto claim your unique username.\n\n🧬 How does this work?\nJust like a real town there is lots of things happening in your local area. When you are signed up, clicking the\nLocal\n/\nLokal\ntab will show you everything that is happening on this website. If you want to explore the wider world, click the\nFederated\n/\nFelles\ntab to see\neverything\nhappening across a lot of websites connected to this one.\nWhen you see someone interesting,\nFollow\n/\nFølg\nthat person for future updates. They will appear in your\nHome\n/\nHjem\ntimeline. You can follow anyone in the whole world - whether they are local or not.\nWhen you see something you didn't want to see, you can\nMute\n/\nDemp\nor\nBlock\n/\nBlokkér\nthat person or the whole website. If you see something on the local timeline which you don't think should be on the internet, you can\nReport\n/\nRapportér\nit to The Mayor.\nFor a more geeky insight into how the site works, you can\nwatch this YouTube video\nor\nread the Documentation\n.\n🏵️ The Mayor\nWhen you sign up to the website, you will instantly be following\n@themayor\nto get the latest updates straight from the oslo.town town hall. It is\nhighly recommended\nthat you follow The Mayor, but it's your life - do what you want - you can always unfollow them.\n\n🧢 Merchandise\nThe lovely people at\n@lokk\nin Oslo have embroidered a baseball cap.\nIf you want one, you can go in the store and order one. Ask the for the oslo.town logo\n(they might need to search their emails for a reference file)\n. Pick out your colour and style of baseball cap. Pay the fine people. And off you go!\n\n📜 Code of Conduct\nIf you want to stick around this place you should just try to be nice to people. As a general rule, that will work fine. Here are some more rules:\n\nNo racism, xenophobia, sexism, discrimination, nazis\n- If you post offensive stuff then you are going to get banned. Just don't be a dick.\n\nUse the Content Warnings\n- Should you feel the need to post some content that might be offensive to someone (explicit nudity, violent or upsetting images, anything you wouldn't like your colleagues to look at) then use the CW feature to hide text and the Sensitive Media checkbox to hide image and video.\n\nNo Robots\n- If you look, sound,and smell like a robot then you might just get deleted. If you want to be a robot, visit\nbotsin.space\n\nPost in any language you like\n- You don't have to speak Norwegian here, but should expect Norwegians to speak Norwegian and foreigners to speak foreign.\n\nSign up now\nto claim your unique username.\n\n🙋 FAQ\nWho actually runs this site?\nThe site is run by the user\n@matt\nbut also pretends to be the character of\n@themayor\n. This is also why everything is in English so far - his Norwegian sucks. Sorry about that.\nHow does the site make money?\nThe site doesn't make money. So long as the site doesn't have hundreds of thousands of users, it isn't very expensive to run. This means it's all paid for by Matt and there is no need to make any money from it. If the cost becomes too much, the site will run on donations.\nSpeaking of which... if you want to donate via cryptocurrency, you can send it to the following addresses:\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n· 1AvHHTMHnVb6NQ99M182pfWLPziAdbPMTM\n\nEther (ETH)\n· 0x6A4471386C4C0404436F7533C686b143fD2B03CC\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n· 1EWfQ6gCv4dVXcGtd6HQwrpp59M3MzoZii\n\nBasic Attention Token (BAT)\n· 0xa655F3E3f2F77271Ba4D4bDccc335373cC145E83\n\nDai Stablecoin (DAI)\n· 0xab4ba46651D292c561609f417d81d37d25289C57\n\nDash (DASH)\n· XiEhbq8Nftb4dAYThX3kBjCjZQQEG9Sw9m\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n· LcBRPgCRD7arLKhiGEVQw6965bw1tL9Xak\n\nZCash (ZEC)\n· t1Zq3L46EJYSMro35nGx6qw1BXC12JVC4XP\n\nAlso, if you are using\nBrave Web Browser\nthen you can Tip and Contribute through Brave Rewards as you browse the site.\nWhy should I use this instead of Facebook / Twitter / etc. ?\nNobody can pretend that\noslo.town\ncan replace any popular social networking website, but it's meant to be a nicer alternative. Unlike the big social networking sites, we don't collect your data and sell it. You are not a product. The whole point of this site is\ncommunity\nand being able to connect with people locally and globally.\nIs my information private?\nThe goal is to collect as little information about the users as possible and that when information is collected, it is stored for as short time as possible. If you care to, you can read the full\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nTo protect your privacy even more, please don't share any personal information with anyone on the site. Think carefully about the username you choose. Share only what you are comfortable sharing.\nDo my posts get listed in Google / Bing / another search engine?\nIn order to protect your privacy, we have opted-out of listing your profile and toots on search engines. You can turn this on yourself in the settings. Please be aware that anyone can still screenshot your toots and sites like\narchive.is\nor\nweb.archive.org\ncould potentially still create a copy of your publicly listed toots.\nNice emoji, huh?\nYeah, we started to use\nMutant Standard emoji\n, which are licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License\nand made by\n@dzuk\n.\nHow do I only see languages I understand?\nWhen you hit the Federated timeline, you will see many users from around the world speaking their native languages. To filter these views to just languages you know, you should\nset up the your language preferences\n.\nHow do I get featured on the Explore page?\nSimple! To get featured on the\nExplore\npage, just go to\nEdit Profile\nand check the box which says\nList this account on the directory\n.\nI see offensive content. Can you block it?\nIf you see an account you see posting offensive content, please use the\nBlock and Report\nfunctionality. If this is content that is not hosted on\noslo.town\nthen check the option which says\nForward to...\nwhich will report the account to the appropriate administrator.\nDirectly from the offensive post, you can also click the option\nBlock Domain\nwhich will prevent you from seeing any future content from that website.\nThe policy at\noslo.town\nis as follows:\n\nWe will ensure that bad things don't happen on the\nLocal timeline\n.\nWe attempt to hide (but not block) any NSFW or spam content from the\nFederated Timeline\n.\nWe block any external accounts or domains that are known to frequently spamming our users.\nPlease allow up to 48 hours to process reports.\n\nHowever, we do not aim to act as your moral compass and will not do domain-wide blocks based on the users of that instance having wild opinions. You should be able to follow anything (even the hidden content) and block these domains or people at your own discretion.\nA full list of hidden or blocked domains is published below.\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

Бэкапы делаются ежедневно ночью.\nОсновная тематика — IT и My little pony, основной язык — русский.\nКак тут оказалось аниме? Без понятия. Оно приёмлимо, но не является ключевой тематикой. Если ты не можешь расценить себя как брони (брони однажды — брони навсегда), возможно этот инстанс не для тебя.\nМы не приветствуем:\nНезаконный контент\nЧрезмерную нецензурную брань\nТравлю\nСпам\n\nЛюбой NSFW контент должен быть помечен как таковой.\nEn\nServer is hosted in Germany, admins are @inexcode and @NaiJi.\nWe mostly post IT and My little pony posts, main language is Russian.\nIf you can't consider yourself as a brony (brony once — brony forever), very likely that this instance is not for you.\nWe do not welcome:\nIllegal content\nExcessive swearing\nTargeted attacks\nSpam\n\nAny NSFW\nmust\nbe marked as sensitive.\nFediverse Friendly Moderation Covenant\nThis instance commits to the following\n1. Administration and Moderation will be handled as neutral as possible\nReports and widespread information on specific instances (often known as bad actors) will be verified and actions might be taken as necessary.\n2. Actions taken will respond to the bare minimum to keep the network operating and not influence the ability of the instances users to connect to other people\n\nIf another instance spreads media content of questionable legality for the region the current instance is operating from, these files might be rejected from being saved.\nIf another instance is sharing hateful messages that impact local users, there might be consideration of silencing that specific instance from being visible in timelines. If users follow and/or wish to follow users on the target instance, they are still free to do so.\nIf another instance is posting content illegal in the local instance operation region or actively posts content attacking local users, a full instance block might be the last resort.\n\n3. Communication before Actions\nIf any of the above behaviours start to surface from a given instance, the moderation of the local instance will attempt to inform the moderation/administration of that instance and resolve the problems coming from there. Only if no communication succeeded or no results that resolved issues came forth, actions will be taken towards that instance.\n4. We won't recommend blocks\nBlocklists and block recommendations as an information source are taken for granted but lack accurate verification. Instead of using these options to publicly announce instances of questionable intent, we will inform local users of such, with the reminder of possible personal options for hiding content that might impact their experience of the network.\n5. No Guilt-by-Association/Federation\nIf we have applied any action against Instance X, an Instance Y that federates with them will not get the same judgement applied to them. A natural connection, as by the networks design, does not imply shared interests and thus doesn't warrant the same moderation methods.\nRegardless of all given points above, in special cases the instance moderation/administration might still opt to block\r\nan instance, while this is tried to be avoided at most.\nThis Covenant is based on\nThe Fediverse-Friendly Moderation Covenant\nand is licensed under CC0\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

        "aboutMore": "\n\nЭто - сервер для общения русскоязычного инклюзивного поли-сообщества и близких людей; но тут рады всем, независимо от того, какие ваши интересы, и на каком языке вы говорите.\nСудя по joinmastodon.org - это единственный русскоязычный инстанс :)\n\nThis Mastodon instance was created for russian-speaking inclusive poly-community and close people; but everybody are welcome there, no matter what they think of polyamory/relationships and what language do they speak\n\nПолезная информация:\nЧто такое Mastodon?\nФункционально это примерно то же самое, что и твиттер, с некоторыми приятными отличиями (точная настройка приватности каждого сообщения, сообщения до 500 символов, возможность делать Content Warning / спойлеры). Ключевое отличие: Mastodon - децентрализованная социальная сеть, её не контролирует никакая организация, как твиттер. Децентрализованность приводит к некоторым дополнительным особенностям:\n\nТвиттер один, а инстансов Mastodon может быть сколько угодно (уже сейчас их больше четырёх тысяч). При этом, инстансы взаимодействуют между собой - ваши сообщения могут репостить пользователи других инстансов (так, что эти сообщения увидят их подписчики), на них могут отвечать пользователи других инстансов (а вы - вступать с ними в переписку); то есть, вы получаете доступ ко всей глобальной федерации Mastodon.\nПолитика модерирования определяется отдельно у каждого конкретного инстанса администраторами этого инстанса в интересах их сообщества (правила этого инстанса - ниже), а не глобально и никому неизвестными сотрудниками твиттера. Модерированием тоже занимаются не неизвестные сотрудники твиттера, а модераторы конкретного инстанса, которые являются частью сообщества этого инстанса.\nВ твиттере надо искать, на кого подписаться; и в своей основной ленте вы будете видеть только тех, на кого подписались. В Mastodon к этому добавляется Local Timeline - это всё, что пишут члены вашего сообщества (пользователи этого инстанса), и Federated Timeline - если упрощённо, то это объединение лент членов вашего сообщества. В твиттере может быть важно, сколько людей на вас подписано, и сколько ретвитов вы получаете; в Mastodon это гораздо менее актуально для интересного общения :)\nАналогия: если твиттер - это собравшиеся в одном месте сотни миллионов человек (среди которых немало плохих людей), пытающиеся перекричать друг друга, то Mastodon - это клубы по интересам и районные площади, где спокойно общаются близкие люди; но при этом между клубами и площадями есть взаимодействие, и в этот наш клуб могут приходить новые люди.\n\nКак найти своих друзей из twitter в Mastodon?\nbridge.joinmastodon.org\nИнтеграция с другими сетями\nМожно настроить кросспостинг между Mastodon и Twitter с помощью\nmoa.party\n. Там же можно настроить и кросспостинг между Instagram и Mastodon.\nКросспостинг между Mastodon во VKontakte можно настроить путём комбинации предыдущего ответа и кросспостинга между Twitter и VKontakte (вконтакте заходим на\nвкладку \"Контакты\"\nв редактировании страницы и включаем кросспостинг).\nЕсли будет спрос - может быть, я когда-то разработаю кросспостинг между Mastodon и Telegram. Сейчас таких готовых решений, вроде бы, нет.\n\nОсновные принципы: свобода слова (в рамках приличий) и свобода не читать чужое слово. На практике это выглядит так:\n\nРамки приличий: абсолютно недопустимы расизм, сексизм, гомофобия, трансфобия и т.п.\nНе отвечать на сообщения других людей тем, что они не хотели бы читать; не упоминать их в таких сообщениях. Например, совершенно точно нельзя мисгендерить людей, отвечать на чужое сообщение \"ты дебил\", писать сообщение \"оказывается, @такой-то - дебил\". Это - примеры для наглядности; конечно, есть и другие. Наличие CW на вашем сообщении значения не имеет.\nЕсли ваше сообщение содержит какие-то спорные материалы, которые ожидаемо могут травмировать и причинить сильные негативные эмоции некоторым потенциальным читателям (например, свидетельства жертв изнасилования, расчленёнка, обнажённые фото и прочий NSFW контент и т.п.) - ставим Content Warning с описанием того, что именно содержит сообщение.\nНикакого доксинга, аутинга, чужих личных фотографий без разрешения изображённых на них людей, никакой детской порнографии... в общем, вы поняли. Санкции - вплоть до мгновенного забана.\nДополненительное правило:\nЭтот сервер расположен в Германии; недопустимо нарушение законов Германии (которые, например, и сами по себе запрещают ЦП).\nЕсли вы видите, что кто-то нарушает эти правила - жалуйтесь модераторам, это нормально и похвально. Если что-то у вас в ленте/уведомлениях вызывает у вас дискомфорт - жалуйтесь, есть техническая возможность блокировать удалённых пользователей или удалённые инстансы целиком.\r\n\r\nУ нас делаются автоматические ежедневные бэкапы, хранятся последние семь бэкапов.\r\n\r\nАдминистратор этого инстанса гарантирует, что в случае планируемого отключения этого инстанса навсегда, пользователи будут предупреждены как минимум за 12 месяцев.\nBasic principles of this community, allowing a civilized discourse both locally and in fediverse: freedom of speech (we are not a \"free speech zone\" though!), and freedom to avoid being harmed by other people's speech. In practice, this is implemented by the following rules:\n\n\"Civilised discourse\" means that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia etc are not tolerated.\nWriting to other people (either by replying to them, or by @-mentioning them) something that they would not like to see is absolutely unacceptable. For example, you should not misgender people, or reply to somebody's toot with \"You're a moron\", or toot \"Turns out @so-and-so is a moron\". These are somewhat extreme examples given for illustrative purposes, but you should get the idea. It does not matter whether these messages are marked by CW or not.\nIf your message can be reasonably assumed to traumatize some other people, hurt their reasonable feelings, or hurt them otherwise, it should be marked by CW describing the topic in question. Some example of CW labels would be, in no specific order or relation: \"I was raped\", \"Gore\", \"Nudity\", \"NSFW\".\nDoxing, outing, publishing personal photos without their subject's consent, CP etc are absolutely forbidden. Violators can be banned permanently on the spot.\nAnd an additional rule...\nThis Mastodon instance runs on server located in Germany; it is forbidden to violate German laws there.\nNote that we do automated daily backups, and that we store last seven backups.\r\n\r\nNote that this server will not be shut down permanently for at least 12 months after the moment this notice is still there.\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse. These are the exceptions that have been made on this particular server.\nSilenced servers\nPosts from these servers will be hidden in public timelines and conversations, and no notifications will be generated from their users interactions, unless you are following them:\n\n\nServer\nReason\n\n\n\ngorf.club\n\n\n\ngs.smuglo.li\n\n\n\npl.smuglo.li\n\n\n\nrainbowdash.net\n\n\n\nsealion.club\n\n\n\nsinblr.com\n\n\n\nsocial.au2pb.net\n\n\n\nsocial.headsca.la\n\n\n\nwoofer.alfter.us\n\n\n\nSuspended servers\nNo data from these servers will be processed, stored or exchanged, making any interaction or communication with users from these servers impossible:\n\n\nServer\nReason\n\n\n\nbitcoinhackers.org\n\n\n\nfreespeechextremist.com\n\n\n\nfreezepeach.xyz\n\n\n\ngab.com\n\n\n\nkiwifarms.cc\n\n\n\nneckbeard.xyz\n\n\n\nshitposter.club\n\n\n\nspinster.xyz\n\n\n\nunsafe.space\n\n\n\n\n",

Feel free to hit me up if you have any questions or requests, be it about this instance, how to make your own instance, or other things not related to Mastodon.\nI am actually the only sysadmin of this instance and I can't work full-time on mhz.social so, I will do whatever I can in a reasonable time to make it works the best it can.\nRules\nThis instance has some rules, of course.\nFirst, there are the usual : no sexism, no racism, no hate speech, no LGBTQphobia, no nazis, no spam, no public unflagged porn, etc...\nThen, I also believe it's important to remind you that this server was made and is run by a queer activist.\nThis server thrives to be inclusive, and I will ban without much regret.\nPeople are encouraged to use the report function as they see fit, and can be confident that their complaints will be heard and dealt with in some way. I want everyone to feel safe here, and if that doesn't sound like something you like, you should probably find another server.\nThis instance, and this entire social network in my opinion, is dedicated to reclaiming social media, decentralizing, and generally creating better and more engaging communities.\n\nSpecs\nCurrently running on\nHetzner Cloud\nhardware.\nOne CX21-CEPH with Nginx, Mastodon WEB, Mastodon Sidekiq and Minio as a S3 assets manager endpoint, PostgreSQL and Redis.\nBackups are taken one time per day using the dedicated paid option of Hetzner.\n\nTerms\nThe server is hosted in Nuremberg\nThe only logs created are the ones from: nginx, mastodon (nodejs, puma web server, sidekiq) and minio (assets).\nThere is no retention currently in place except the by-default on Debian.\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

With that, please know that our Code of Conduct is written with this in mind.\nIn addition: This instance is (obviously) Stardew Valley themed, but this does not mean that the only content you are allowed to post here is Stardew Valley related content!\nYou may use this instance as your main/personal/private/whatever instance. It is a “general” instance, just with a cute theme. This is also does not mean that you are disallowed from having a purely Stardew Valley account on this instance. You may do as you wish, as long as it follows our Code of Conduct.\nPosting Etiquette\nPart of kindfulness is consent to interactions. Some folks may not want to see certain content, and thus being mindful of this as well as kind to others we ask that you use the Content Warning (CW) function and/or the eyeball function to hide photos for the following topics:\n\nSexual violence\nExamples of CW subject:\nRape, sexual assault, Title IX (USPol)\nChildhood sexual abuse (CSA)\nStalking, abusive relationship\nAbusive relationship (not me), asking for help\n\n\nPolitics / news\nExamples of CW subject:\nUSPol, police brutality\nUKPol, Brexit\nUSPol, trump\nPolitical theory\n\n\nMental health issues (especially those that could trigger others: suicide, self-harm, disordered eating, etc.)\nExamples of CW subject:\nMental health talk, anxiety\nMental health, suicidal ideation\nMental health questions, therapy\nMental health medications, side effects, negative\n\n\nMedical health issues (especially those others may find triggering: cancer, hospice, vomit, other bodily fluids, etc.)\nAbortion and miscarriages (although not a medical health “issue”) are included under this\n\nCross-posts from other social media sites (mainly Twitter)\nExample CW subjects:\nTwitter cross-post (user / OP of tweet)\n\nWhile cross-posting is not outrightly banned, if it becomes your main or only form of posting on the instance, you will be asked to move to another instance\n\nJump scares or other scare tactics\nPosts that may qualify as “body horror”\nFlashing images or videos\nSpoilers to television shows or movies\nFood, dieting, or weight discussion\nDrugs or alcohol\nViolence, either implied of explicit (images of guns/weapons, images with blood, written post about injuries, etc.)\nSexually explicit content (nudity, kink talk, etc.)\nExamples of CW subject:\nLewd, nudity\nKink, BDSM\nPhotos of me in lingerie\nSexual frustration, masturbation\n\n\nAnimal abuse/cruelty\nDeath\nHate topics (heterosexism/homophobia, racism, transmisogyny and transphobia, etc.)\n“Meta” discussions of issues on the fediverse\nExamples of CW subject:\nMeta (admin/moderation)\nMeta (pixelfed)\nMeta (blocking)\n\n\nEmoji spam or ASCII posts\nThis includes spelling things out with emoji letters\n\nIf the post is a joke, or a “shitpost” please say so!\n\nWe find it exceptionally important to be specific, but not detailed, in our CW subjects. This takes practice, and will never be a perfect science as we do not always know what will trigger others. That is okay! It is okay to make mistakes, and it is not something that will cause a ban from our instance unless it becomes a larger issue. Many topics may overlap, so please just try your best.\nIt is not required to use the format or even specific examples mentioned for posts of that subject matter, they are only there as a guide for those who may be unfamiliar with the CW system, and as a guide for specificity for those who are used to it but are new to this instance.\nAbbreviations/Short Cuts in CW Subjects\nIf you like to use abbreviations, please type out the full word/phrase in the first toot and put the abbreviations next to it (i.e. “childhood sexual abuse (CSA)”, “Austrailian Politics (AUSPol)”, “suicidal ideation (sui), negative (-/neg)”, etc.) and then continue to use the abbreviation in your subject as you thread your discussion/posts.\nAbbreviations are tricky and not always recognizable to users, especially new ones. Some folks on the fediverse have pinned a toot of their commonly used abbreviations, so feel free to use this method as well!\nPlease do not purposefully misspell words or censor words (l*ke th*s) as it bypasses the filter system in place, causing posts with words originally filtered out to sneak through.\nWe highly encourage the use of filters for triggers that may be specific to you, or less common to the general public as it will help protect you from having to interact with or even see posts surrounding that word/topic/person.\nWhen in doubt, use the CW and/or hide your images!\nSelf-Promotion\nAn exception to the idea of “when in doubt, use a CW” would be self-promotion or asking for help. Please do not feel obligated to CW these posts. You should never feel bad about earning money through skills you have, or asking for help when you need it!\nHowever, it may become an issue if that is the only kind of post you seem to be making, and/or you are continuously making the same post super often (spamming).\nAccessibility\nWith that, we would like to add that we encourage all users to do their best with image descriptions! This can be done via that instance UI on the image, or within the text of the post itself. This is not required to be on the instance, and is also not something that would result in a ban, but please push yourself to remember to caption/describe your images (including: memes, selfies, screen captures of text, etc.). Your description does not have to be perfect or of exceptional detail and length. We only ask that you try your best. If you’re ever unsure about what to say in an image caption, just ask!\nWe also encourage capitalization of hashtags #LikeThis, rather than #likethis (in addition to the emoji spam/ASCII content rule) so that screen readers can properly read hashtags.\nBe kind and mindful in hopes to make our instance and the fediverse a more accessible place.\nSerious Offenses\nThe following content is prohibited on Stardew.City and will result in an immediate removal of content, and removal of your account:\n\nSexual depictions of children / pedophilia\nA minor (or child) is someone below the age of eighteen (18) years old\nThis includes but is not limited to:\nDrawings, photographs, videos, or writing of children engaging in sexual activity (including fictional characters)\nAforementioned with “aged-up” fictional child characters\nCharacters that are of age, but have an intentional child-like appearance engaging in sexual activity\nEngaging in sexual conversations with children as an adult\nThis is not to say that if a minor has questions, you as an adult may not offer help/answers. Be respectful and understanding of boundaries laid by minors, as well as your responsibilities as an adult to not encourage or engage in sexual relationships with minors.\n\n\n\nHolocaust denial\nNazi imagery, or other promotion of fascism/radical nationalism\nYes, even “ironically”\n\nPromoting the oppression or discrimination against any person or groups based on race, ethnicity, nationality, sex, gender (identity or expression), sexuality/sexual orientation, disability, class, profession, body size or personal appearance, age, or religion.\nHarassment, stalking, or threats/intimidation of other users, or encouraging others to do so\nThis includes but is not limited to:\nContinuously trying to engage a user who has requested to end interaction(s)\nEncouraging or inciting other users to (re)engage with another user after said user requested to end interactions\nScreen capturing or quoting a user without their express permission\nCollecting or posting a user’s private or personal information or data without express permission\nThis includes but is not limited to:\nAddresses associated with a user\nA name they previously had or were associated with\nContact information such as a phone number or email address\nAny of the aforementioned in relation to a partner or family member of a user\n\n\n\n\nIntentionally spreading libel, slander, or other disinformation\nCertain websites that tend to target others, or right-wing websites, will not count as “proof” to the admin if concerns about certain folks arise\n\nPlagiarism, or art theft (posting other’s work without citation or credit, or claiming it as your own)\nCrypto mining operations\nUnapproved bots\nContact your admin for approval!\n\nUntagged:\nSexually explicit content\nGore or graphic violence\n\n\nThese rules apply to Stardew.City or any affiliated location (such as an offline meet up, or if you promote the instance elsewhere/are representing the instance elsewhere on the web or offline).\nReports will be reviewed and decisions will be made as soon as possible. Admins and moderators must maintain confidentiality with the identity of the reporter of the incident.\nThe admin reserves the right to delete a user’s content or revoke access to Stardew.City at any time or for any reason.\nAny changes to the COC will be publicly posted about for users to read the changes.\nSuspensions and Silences\nOur list of blocked/suspended and muted/silenced instances is maintained solely by our moderation team. We follow already maintained block lists of other instances such as: kitty.town, dzuk’s blockchain list on github, the use of #FediBlock, and the posts of other admin’s our team trusts.\nUsers are absolutely encouraged to contact the admin to request a block, and/or report the instance through the moderation tools. Reporting is very useful, as it allows us to keep better track and write notes to remember what happened/why we blocked someone via the Mastodon interface.\nIf users on an instance repeatedly engage in behaviors against our on COC, without appropriate reactions from the moderation team, and/or if the admin or mods of an instance engage in behaviors against our COC the instance will be suspended rather than just the offending users.\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse. These are the exceptions that have been made on this particular server.\nFiltered media\nMedia files from these servers will not be processed or stored, and no thumbnails will be displayed, requiring

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.\nApplicability and Scope\nThis code of conduct applies to all of this community's spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.\nToward a Welcoming and Safe Environment\nWe hope to create an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and interact in a positive and affirming way. Examples of behavior that contributes to creating this sort of environment include:\n\nUsing welcoming and inclusive language\nBeing respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accepting constructive criticism\nFocusing on what is best for the overall community\nShowing empathy towards other community members\n\nAnti-Harassment Statement\nThis community will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Examples of harassment include:\n\nOffensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, pregnancy status, veteran status, political affiliation, marital status, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker. This includes anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.\nUnwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.\nDeliberate misgendering, using inappropriate pronouns, or use of \"dead\" or rejected names.\nGratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they're not appropriate.\nPhysical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like \"hug\" or \"backrub\") without consent or after a request to stop.\nThreats of violence.\nIncitement of violence towards any individual or group, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.\nDeliberate intimidation.\nStalking or following - online or in the physical world.\nHarassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.\nSustained disruption of discussion.\nUnwelcome sexual attention.\nPatterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.\nContinued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.\nDeliberate \"outing\" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.\nPublication of non-harassing private communication.\nJokes that resemble the above, such as \"hipster racism\", still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these issues please feel free to message an admin or ask for an opportunity to explore the issue with a moderator and volunteers.\nReporting\nIf you are being harassed by a member of our community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the administrators via email or DM. If the person who is harassing you is on the admin team, they will not be involved in handling or resolving the incident.\nThe admin team will respond to any complaint as promptly as possible we can. If you do not get a timely response (for example, if no admins are currently online) then please put your personal safety and well-being first, and consider logging out and/or contacting the admins by email at notifications@iam.lydi.as.\nThis code of conduct applies to our community's spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by our members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces and behavior towards people who are not in this community.\nIn order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.\nEnforcement Process\nEvery code of conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care. If a member's immediate safety and security is threatened, an individual admin may take any action that they deem appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from the community. In less urgent situations, at least two admins will discuss the offense and mutually arrive at a suitable response, which will be shared with the offender privately. Whatever the resolution that they decide upon, the decision of the admins involved in a violation case will be considered final.\nWe will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of our members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.\nConsequences\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community and identification of the participant as a harasser to other members. At the discretion of the admins, or by request, one or more of the parties involved may request to discuss the violation and how to avoid similar situations in the future.\nAcknowledgements\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Community Covenant (\nhttp://community-covenant.net\n), version 1.0, available at\nhttp://community-covenant.net/version/1/0/\n.

Who is this instance for?\nMania Systems a retro-futurist themed community for independent, underground, and non-traditional artists and creatives who want to share their work, meet each other, and collaborate, all in a safe space.\nWe specifically try to build for the intersections of being queer, being chronically ill or disabled, being neuroatypical, and being mixed-race or brown - because that's who we are. Pretty much everyone is welcome (subject to our\ncode of conduct\n), but we prioritise the safety and comfort of our communities.\nWhat do you mean, nontraditional artists and creatives?\nFor example:\n\nAny artists or creatives working outside academia or \"formal institutions\"\nUnderground & indie zines and zinemakers\nWriters working outside academia\nStreet artists\nAnyone fusing art and technology (e.g. code-as-art, digital music, etc)\nFound artists\n\nAnyone\nwho's had to ask if their art counts as art\n\nAs long as you keep this space safe & respectful, you're welcome here.\nTake a look at the\nwebsite\nfor more information. There's also a number of other apps and platforms run here.\nKeeping safe & respectful\nRespect people.\nHarassment will not be tolerated, oppressive behavior will not be tolerated, and while failure to recognize the boundaries of others may be met at first with a gentle attempt to educate you, repeated failure will not be tolerated.\nUse our platform, don't frack it.\nNo brands, no marketing, no data-miners. You're here to use it for its social function, not to exploit it for some other purpose.\nLeave your shit at the door.\nThere's nothing interesting about homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism, ableism or any of the other unexamined default settings some people grow up with. Being a nazi isn't non-traditional, it's shitty and aggressively boring - take it somewhere else. You can feel free to disagree somewhere else where none of us have to hear you.

Some of them may be tired or having a bad day. Or you might.\nYou don't have to agree with someone to be civil to them. If you can't be civil to someone, leave them\r\n    alone.\nIf you don't wish to interact with someone, or see any of their posts, there are tools at your disposal\r\n    including mute and block functions.\nIf someone's posts make you angry or upset, take some time to calm down before you reply. You might also try\r\n    simply excusing yourself from a conversation and ask them to untag you if you no longer wish to discuss a topic.\n\nWhen someone asks you to leave them alone, leave them alone. If you feel like you can't control your urge to\r\n    respond to that person, use the block or mute feature so you won't see their posts and be tempted.\nKeep in mind that while you cannot control other people's behavior, you are still responsible for your own\r\n    conduct, even if you feel someone was rude to you or someone else.\nWe will not allow abusive or disruptive conduct by or toward users on meinungsschubla.de. This includes continuing to\r\n    engage in conversation with someone who has specifically requested you leave them alone, inciting other users to\r\n    engage with that person on your behalf, aggregating and posting another person's personal information without\r\n    their consent, and inciting others to engage with that person on other platforms. Blocking someone and then sitting\r\n    on the other side of a block and continuing to talk about that person is also a provoking behavior.\nBefore you post, think about whether this is the kind of thing you would like to see (or would like your mom or kids\r\n    to see) in the public timeline. There are post visibility settings that give you some control over which timelines\r\n    your post appears in, and also CW and NSFW buttons to hide specific text and images in your post. Be a good social\r\n    media neighbor and use these functions when appropriate.\n\nContent not allowed on meinungsschubla.de\n\nSexual depictions of children\nContent illegal in Germany and/or France, such as holocaust denial or Nazi symbolism\nConduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism\n\nContent which will be removed from the public timeline:\n\nExcessive advertising\nUntagged pornography- and sexually explicit content\nUntagged gore and extremely graphic violence\nWe will also remove any content we judge to be hateful toward specific individuals or groups, or intended to\r\n        cause or incite harm from the public timeline.\r\n\r\n        This guideline is intentionally vague because we do not intend to play \"rules lawyer\" on the subject\r\n        of what it is and isn't okay to say about people. A good rule of thumb is, if you're about to say\r\n        something you think might fall foul of this rule, you probably shouldn't say it. ☺\n\nTimeline Flooding\nIn order to keep the best user experience, we ask you not to send like twenty toots in two minutes (exemplification)\r\n    as people want to be able to see more than just one user in their timelines.\nOf course we understand and may do an exception for critical reasons of yours like a kind of serious emergency\r\n    situation for example.\n\nReporting / Moderation Notes\nIf you see content which you believe is in breach of these rules, please report it for review,\nit is very\r\n    important for us, as it makes our work easier and this instance a more enjoyable place.\nPlease note however that repeately falsely reporting users is not welcomed and are treated as feature-abuse.\nIn case you broke our rules by mistake, we may try to reach out to you so please make sure not to block the team of\r\n    meinungsschubla.de.\nThese guidelines are not a legal document, they're here to provide you with an insight into\r\n    our moderation policies. Final interpretation is up to the administration of meinungsschubla.de and the\r\n    administration reserves the right to revoke any user's access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except\r\n    as limited by law.\n\nStaff\n\n@Nico\n(Site Owner)\n\nFederation status\nmeinungsschubla.de does not believe in censorship. Federation is a network service and suspension of federation with\r\n    another server will only be implemented as a last resort where content from another server may cause problems under\r\n    German law, or in cases of technical difficulties or hostile or malicious activity. If we need to suspend\r\n    federation or silence another instance for one/some of these reasons, it will be noted here (now further below). Did we make a wrong\r\n    decision in your opinion? Ping us!\n\n(Note: you can still communicate with users on silenced instances; their posts will not appear in our public\r\n    timelines. You will not be able to see posts made by users on suspended instances.)\n\nReporting an issue\nFor technical issues, use the administrator contact information listed under \"Contact\"\r\nFor content or abuse issues:\n\nif you're a user on meinungsschubla.de you can use the \"Report Abuse\" function on the post you\r\n        would like to report;\nIf you're not a user on meinungsschubla.de, or you're an administrator of another server who would like\r\n        to discuss an abuse report you received about one of our users, please use the administrator email listed under\r\n        \"Contact\"\n\nFor privacy reasons, we will not discuss abuse reports in public channels.\n\nPrivacy\nPlease remember that nothing on the internet is really private and consider anything you say saved forever.

However, it is not exempt from real-world issues, so some genuine community guidelines are in order...\nIn short, the following is a list of activities / language that will not be tolerated here:\n\nmalicious comments about race, ethnicity, gender, or religion\nxenophobic/violent nationalism\ngeneral bigotry or harassment\nimplicit or explicit advocacy for any of the above\n\nAs a user of this instance, you trust us to enforce these guidelines upon the community. In return, I ask that you take it upon yourself to enact them, and work to make this server a safe and inclusive place.\nArchival Policy\nDigital archival does not combine favorably with many types of social networks - most exist as spaces that facilitate our identity and inherently communicate personal thoughts and events. We believe that certain types of content, particularly that which resides in this instance, should eventually be forgotten at some point in time. Our views and identities can change - as a community, we should allow that to happen and move on.\nFor this reason, our instance avoids any type of data mining or analytics whenever possible. We do not consent to this site, its posts, or its users being archived, scraped, or indexed on any external site or storage such as the \"wayback machine\" or other types of historical archiving. Consider this an opt-out of any newfangled fedi-search browser plugin index tool.\nBlocked Domains\nWe don't block domains lightly, but will not hesitate to exercise our power to \"break the fediverse\" when people are at risk of harassment.\nIn the event that any behavior is observed to exceed beyond the boundaries of our community guidelines, please use the \"report\" button (in the \"...\" menu of a user's profile) or contact a moderator / admin. Alternatively, you may send an email to\nmoderation@horrific.dev\n.\nUnavailable content\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse. These are the exceptions that have been made on this particular server.\nPosts from these servers will be hidden in public timelines and conversations, and no notifications will be generated from their users' interactions, unless you are following them:\n\n\nServer\nReason\n\n\n\nswitter.at\n\nnon-CW'd NSFW\n\n\nNo data from these servers will be processed, stored or exchanged, making any interaction or communication with users from these servers impossible:\n\n\nServer\nReason\n\n\n\nantitwitter.com\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\ncrypto-group-buy.com\n\nspam instance\n\n\ndevelop.gab.com\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nexited.eu\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nexpired.mentality.rip\n\nableism\n\n\nexplosion.party\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nfreespeechextremist.com\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nfreezepeach.xyz\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\ngameliberty.club\n\nnazism, racism, ableism, etc.\n\n\ngamers.exposed\n\nassault, racism\n\n\ngleasonator.com\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nhusk.site\n\nfascism, etc\n\n\nkiwifarms.cc\n\nharassment\n\n\nkiwifarms.is\n\nharassment\n\n\nkiwifarms.net\n\nharassment\n\n\nkoyu.space\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nlbry.world\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nlets.saynoto.lgbt\n\ntransphobia\n\n\nneckbeard.xyz\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nnoagendasocial.com\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\npeertube.bittube.video\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\npeertube.quaylessed.icu\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nshitposter.club\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nsocial.sphere.com.ai\n\ndata collection / archival\n\n\nspinster.xyz\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nthechad.zone\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nthewired.xyz\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\ntraboone.com\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nunsafe.space\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nwrongthink.net\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\nwurm.host\n\nnegligent moderation\n\n\n",

You can use different visibilities for that purpose. Answers to messages can and should generally be put in 'unlisted', to avoid clogging the public timeline with a given thread (it'll still appear in your follower's home though)\nDescribe the images you post, when and if you can. Try to think about people that could read them if they cannot see the picture.\nActivate the sensitive warning (the eye) if the image might trigger other people (gore, nudity, etc)\nGenerally, try to think about the people reading your posts.

Si vous souhaitez rejoindre le Fédiverse, essayez une des instances listées\nici\n!\nJe suspendrai sans hésiter toutes les instances ou les comptes qui diffusent ou tolèrent, entres autres : racisme, anti-sémitisme, LGBTIphobies, sexisme, validisme, idéologie d'extrême-droite, pédophilie, zoophilie... Et je vous préviens, ma limite de patience est assez basse pour ces choses là. De même je silencerai les instances ou les comptes qui ne mettent pas d'avertissement de contenu sur leurs médias pour le contenu NSFW.\nNote : si vous estimez avoir une bonne raison de suspendre ou silencer cette instance ou mon compte, merci de me contacter par message privé afin que nous puissions trouver une solution. Si j'ai dit ou fait quelque chose d'inapproprié, je préfère être au courant pour ne pas recommencer plutôt que d'être bloqué du Fédiverse. J'essaye au mieux d'être un être humain décent, mais ça peut m'arriver de dire ou de faire du mal sans le vouloir, comme tout à chacun.\n[EN] Welcome to my place!\nHi, this is my personal space! Please call me Renn, I own this instance that I use solely for personal purposes. If you wish to join the Fediverse, please check out one of the servers listed\nthere\n!\nI will suspend without hesitation any instance or account that diffuses or tolerates, among others: racism, antisemitism, LGBTIphobia, sexism, ableism, alt-right ideologies, pedophilia, zoophilia... Be warned, my threshold is quite low for this sort of thing. Moreover, I will silence any instance or account that doesn't put a content warning on NSFW media.\nN.B. : if you think you have a good reason to suspend or silence this instance or my account, please contact me with a direct message, so that we can find a solution. If I said or did something inappropriate, I would rather be informed so that I don't do it again, instead of getting blocked from the Fediverse. I try to be a decent human being, but sometimes I say or do bad things without wanting to, as everyone does.\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

Administration and Moderation will be handled as neutral as possible\nReports and widespread information on specific instances (often known as\nbad actors\n) will be verified\r\nand actions might be taken as necessary.\n2. Actions taken will respond to the bare minimum to keep the network operating and not influence the ability of the instances users to connect to other people\n\nIf another instance spreads media content of questionable legality for the region the current instance\r\nis operating from, these\nfiles might be rejected\nfrom being saved.\nIf another instance is sharing hateful messages that impact local users, there might be consideration\r\nof\nsilencing\nthat specific instance from being visible in timelines. If users follow and/or wish to follow\r\nusers on the target instance, they are still free to do so.\nIf another instance is posting content illegal in the local instance operation region or actively posts content\r\nattacking local users, a full\ninstance block\nmight be the last resort.\n\n3. Communication before Actions\nIf any of the above behaviours start to surface from a given instance, the moderation of the local instance will attempt\r\nto inform the moderation/administration of that instance and resolve the problems coming from there. Only if no communication succeeded or no results that resolved issues came forth, actions will be taken towards that instance.\n4. We won't recommend blocks\nBlocklists and block recommendations as an information source are taken for granted but lack accurate verification. Instead of using these options to publicly announce instances of questionable intent, we will inform local users of such, with the reminder of possible personal options for hiding content that might impact their experience of the network.\n5. No Guilt-by-Association/Federation\nIf we have applied any action against Instance X, an Instance Y that federates with them will not get the same judgement applied to them. A natural connection, as by the networks design, does not imply shared interests and thus doesn't warrant the same moderation methods.\n\nRegardless of all given points above, in special cases the instance moderation/administration might still opt to block\r\nan instance, while this is tried to be avoided at most.\n\nThis Covenant is based on\nThe Fediverse-Friendly Moderation Covenant\nModerated servers\nMastodon generally allows you to view content from and interact with users from any other server in the fediverse.

Some of them may be tired or having a bad day. Or you might.\nYou don't have to agree with someone to be civil to them. If you can't be civil to someone, leave them\r\n    alone.\nIf you don't wish to interact with someone, or see any of their posts, there are tools at your disposal\r\n    including mute and block functions.\nIf someone's posts make you angry or upset, take some time to calm down before you reply. You might also try\r\n    simply excusing yourself from a conversation and ask them to untag you if you no longer wish to discuss a topic.\n\nWhen someone asks you to leave them alone, leave them alone. If you feel like you can't control your urge to\r\n    respond to that person, use the block or mute feature so you won't see their posts and be tempted.\nKeep in mind that while you cannot control other people's behavior, you are still responsible for your own\r\n    conduct, even if you feel someone was rude to you or someone else.\nWe will not allow abusive or disruptive conduct by or toward users on social.tchncs.de. This includes continuing to\r\n    engage in conversation with someone who has specifically requested you leave them alone, inciting other users to\r\n    engage with that person on your behalf, aggregating and posting another person's personal information without\r\n    their consent, and inciting others to engage with that person on other platforms. Blocking someone and then sitting\r\n    on the other side of a block and continuing to talk about that person is also a provoking behavior.\nBefore you post, think about whether this is the kind of thing you would like to see (or would like your mom or kids\r\n    to see) in the public timeline. There are post visibility settings that give you some control over which timelines\r\n    your post appears in, and also CW and NSFW buttons to hide specific text and images in your post. Be a good social\r\n    media neighbor and use these functions when appropriate.\n\nContent not allowed on social.tchncs.de\n\nSexual depictions of children\nContent illegal in Germany and/or France, such as holocaust denial or Nazi symbolism\nConduct promoting the ideology of National Socialism\nContent that is considered to be misinformation/conspiracy\n\nContent which will be removed from the public timeline:\n\nExcessive advertising\nUntagged pornography- and sexually explicit content\nUntagged gore and extremely graphic violence\nWe will also remove any content we judge to be hateful toward specific individuals or groups, or intended to\r\n        cause or incite harm from the public timeline.\r\n\r\n        This guideline is intentionally vague because we do not intend to play \"rules lawyer\" on the subject\r\n        of what it is and isn't okay to say about people. A good rule of thumb is, if you're about to say\r\n        something you think might fall foul of this rule, you probably shouldn't say it. ☺\n\nTimeline Flooding\nIn order to keep the best user experience, we ask you not to send like twenty toots in two minutes (exemplification)\r\n    as people want to be able to see more than just one user in their timelines.\nOf course we understand and may do an exception for critical reasons of yours like a kind of serious emergency\r\n    situation for example.\n\nReporting / Moderation Notes\nIf you see content which you believe is in breach of these rules, please report it for review,\nit is very\r\n    important for us, as it makes our work easier and this instance a more enjoyable place.\nPlease note however that repeately falsely reporting users is not welcomed and are treated as feature-abuse.\nIn case you broke our rules by mistake, we may try to reach out to you so please make sure not to block the team of\r\n    social.tchncs.de.\nThese guidelines are not a legal document, they're here to provide you with an insight into\r\n    our moderation policies. Final interpretation is up to the administration of social.tchncs.de and the\r\n    administration reserves the right to revoke any user's access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except\r\n    as limited by law.\n\nStaff\n\n@Cedara\n(Moderator)\n\n@Meldrian\n(Moderator)\n\n@Milan\n(Site Owner)\n\nFederation status\nsocial.tchncs.de does not believe in censorship. Federation is a network service and suspension of federation with\r\n    another server will only be implemented as a last resort where content from another server may cause problems under\r\n    German law, or in cases of technical difficulties or hostile or malicious activity. If we need to suspend\r\n    federation or silence another instance for one/some of these reasons, it will be noted here (now further below). Did we make a wrong\r\n    decision in your opinion? Ping us!\n\n(Note: you can still communicate with users on silenced instances; their posts will not appear in our public\r\n    timelines. You will not be able to see posts made by users on suspended instances.)\n\nReporting an issue\nFor technical issues, use the administrator contact information listed under \"Contact\"\r\nFor content or abuse issues:\n\nif you're a user on social.tchncs.de you can use the \"Report Abuse\" function on the post you\r\n        would like to report;\nIf you're not a user on social.tchncs.de, or you're an administrator of another server who would like\r\n        to discuss an abuse report you received about one of our users, please use the administrator email listed under\r\n        \"Contact\"\n\nFor privacy reasons, we will not discuss abuse reports in public channels.\n\nFunding\nOur servers and related are\ncrowdfunded\nand\r\n    thereby made possible by our amazing community. 😍\n\nPrivacy\nPlease remember that nothing on the internet is really private and consider anything you say saved forever.

Please feel free to join us here, if you do, know that we ask everyone to keep a few things in mind. \r\nThe following list is not exhaustive, and will be modified and expanded over time. Look, if you get it and you you're good with it, great. If you don't get it, figure it out - we can help! If you don't want to get it, maybe find somewhere else to hang your hat.\nBe you\nThis is a space to celebrate our diversity. Here you don't need to be a brand, be true to yourself and let others do the same.\nCultivate a Safe Atmosphere\nHarassment will not be tolerated, oppressive behavior will not be tolerated, and while failure to recognize the boundaries of others may be met at first with a gentle attempt to educate you, repeated failure will not be tolerated.\nShare Things\nTalk about what you are up to! Talk to other people about what they are up to! Make things! Share you patreon! Post your art! Share your knowledge! ask the questions that keep you awake at night.\nBanal Bullshit Unwelcome\nThere's nothing interesting about homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism or any of the other unexamined default settings some people grow up with. Being a nazi isn't an opinion, it's shitty and aggressively boring - take it somewhere else. You can feel free to disagree somewhere else where none of us have to hear you.\nEnforced strictly.\n\nStanding on the Shoulders of Giants\nRules, Etiquette, Bots, block list\nWe are very thankful to other community like weirder.earth and sleeping.town and the people running them.\r\nThey allow people to use their extensive rules, policies and hard gained knowledge about unsafe communities out there.\nEmojos\nThis community uses Mutant Standard emoji, which are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\nModeration\nThe current moderation is done by 4 (four) persons with varying amount of spoons.
